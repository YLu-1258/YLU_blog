## Code Reflection/ Knolwedge gained
Overall, I feel like the project this trimester has forced me to go beyond the usual algorithms I write to research, design, and formulate a unique algorithm that people (in this class) haven't seen before. Being in CSA, I was able to successfully incorporate aspects of Object-Oriented Programming into my backend and frontend code to make the  project work efficient and modularily. Additionally, I was able to make use of my knowledge in applied/discrete math to actually understand the proofs for the Dijkstra algorithm, when it came to proving its running time and space complexity. Doing so made designing more complex objects, such as the weighted graph, or the controllers for the frontend easier to manage, and more versatile as a result.

## Teamwork/Agile Reflection, Improvements to be made
There were both positives and negative when it came to teamwork and our agile manifesto.  

On the positive side, our group was especially effective at communicating with each other outside of the classroom. We would gather in other classrooms during lunch to plan our a projects on the whiteboards with everyone else, as seen in this issue: https://github.com/CSA-Tri-1/DADDJbackend/issues/2. Aditionally, we made good use of other technologies to reinforce team work, such as a dedicated scrumboard to manage our issues and tasks, vscode live share to colaborately work on code, and discord calls for remote communication.

However, improvements can be made with our focus and agile methodology. Some group members were a little bit off focus or unattentative during coding sessions and presentation, which may have contributed to a more negative experience for the consumers of our product. Additionally, we were a little bit rushed towards the end for our project, because we had to switch the frontend implementations 2 times. These obstacles could've been avoided in the feature weel phase if we had a more solid plan for tackling how our project operated. This is definitely something to improve for trimester 2.

## Final thoughts
Overall, I believe that this trimester was an especially rewarding experience. Not only did I gain experience in working with higher level algorithms that aren't covered by the CollegeBoard curriculum, I have also been inspired by other N@TM projects for new ideas for projects whether it be in the classroom or outside. It was also a good lesson learned that most frameworks don't work well with each other, and careful planning is paramount for a successful and cohesive project.
