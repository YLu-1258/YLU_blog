# Lecture
- To build a list that can grow infinitely large, we must use recursion.

## Bits
- Computers stores information in memory as sequence of ones and zeros.
- When variables are declared in Java, the computer sets aside exactly enough bits to hold an object/thing of that type.
    - Declaring an int sets a box of 32 bits.
    - Declaring a double sets aside a box of 64 bits.
- **Golden Rule of Equals (GRoE):** In Java, the equals sign copies the bits from one variable to another variable.
- Everything in Java that is not a primitive is called a reference type.
- When an object of a reference type is instantiated:
    - Java initializes memory for each instance variable of the class.
    - Java then stores the address to the object as an integer to the variable. The `new` keyword finds a place in memory to allocate the object to, and then returns the address of the new object.

## Parameter Passing
- Passing parameters to a function also follows the golden rule of equals.
    - Bits are copied over into new variables defined in the function signature.
    - Java is a purely pass by value language.

## Comparison
- The `==` operator compares the bits in the two memory boxes.
- To compare the content of two arrays, use `Arrays.equals`
