## Two Trimester Focus Planning

### Test data capture
During N@tM, we had students and parents come to our table and test out our product. The primary form of data that we collected was the anticipated stock prices the consumer would but and also their desired amount. After grabbing such data from the frontend, we stored the data in the backend in our database wit a JSONb column. We are hopeful that once we finish implementing patch 2 of our neural network, that it becomes possible to use the user generated data for comparisons to allow the users to see how well their predictions performed against the AI.

### Feedback/additions
One parent in particular, was very knowledgeable on our topic. From him, we learned that a better alternative to LSTMs could be transformers. I've had limited experiences with transformers, but from what I know, transformers relies on multi-headed attention to focus on different areas and factors to make predictions. If we have time, we may consider adding transformers to our neural network to improve the overall performance.

## Me and the team
At N@tM, my team was split between two time periods. 6:00-6:30 pm was for our team in period 1, while 6:30-7:00 was for our team in period 3. As SCRUM master and the initial visionary for this project, I was there for the full duration.

### Glows
For the most part, me, david, and adi were pretty successful at pitching and introducing the projects to others. Each one of us had worked on a different feature for the product (I did the neural network, Adi did backend code for user updates, and David worked on the frontend display). We were able to pool together all our efforts and build up a convincing argument for why our product should be used. Additionally, most members of the team were active contributors to the codebase, which is a lot better than what I have expected from previous trimesters. Keeping up this productivity, I can expect our teams to plan and draft much more features than past CSA projects I've been in. Overall, we did a great job synergizing each others parts with one another, and successfully pitched our ideas to the audience.

### Grows
One area where we can improve on is having more members of the team contribute to the presentation. For the most part, the presentation was done by one half of the team rather than the other, so it would've been nice to see other members of the team participating more in the event. Additionally, although the issue isn't as bad as before, we should start to use more branches and pull requests to separate our code. That way, we can better improve the efficiency at which we push out new features for our next demo.

### Visuals 
For the most part, I was presenting our project. However, I did have this picture of Saathvik experimenting around with our project.

## Blog on event

### Things I saw in CS that impressed me:
One of the groups (I think Emma's), worked on a project where they planned to introduce their users to different cyber exploits and system vulnerabilities. As I have background in this field through CyberPatriot, I found their project very interesting because it explores the other side of software engineering, where we have to be judicious with our programming to ensure that our systems are secure.

### Things outside of CS that impressed me:
One of the other groups, I think it was Rachit's group, who created a coding-education game that was going to be powered by AI. However, the group also created many art assests of their own that were consistent with the theme of the project. I found it a cool way to incorporate more aspects of other disciplines into CS>
