# Lecture
- We notice that adding to the back of an `SLList` is much slower than adding to the front.
    - We must traverse through the entire list.
- We must change our data structure so that adding to the end of the list is also fast.
    - One idea is to "cache" the last node, so that we point at the last item in the list.
    - But a better idea is to use a sentinel for the end too. Our last reference could point to either a real node or a sentinel node.
- For the sentinel node, we could add sentinels to both ends of the list, or we can have the sentinel loop back to itself.

# Make Our class Generic.
- Specify the generic type only once at the very top of the file.
- In java files, specify the desired type during declaration, and use the empty diamond operator <> during instantiation.
- When instantiating your data structure, we use the reference type rather than the primitive type.



```java
public class SLList<T> {
    private class Node {
        public T item;
        public Node next;
    
        public Node(T i, Node n) {
            item = i;
            next = n;
        }
    }

    private Node sentinel;
    private int size;

    public SLList(T x) {
        sentinel = new Node(null, null);
        sentinel.next = new Node(x, null);
        size = 1;
    }

    public SLList() {
        sentinel = new Node(null, null);
        size = 0;
    }

    public void addFirst(T x) {
        sentinel.next = new Node(x, sentinel.next);
        size+=1;
    }

    public T getFirst() {
        return sentinel.next.item;
    }

    public T get(int i) {
        Node dummy = sentinel; 
        while (i > -1 && dummy.next != null) {
            dummy = dummy.next;
            i--;
        }
        return dummy.item;
    }

    public void addLast(T x) {
        Node dummy = sentinel;
        while (dummy.next != null) {
            dummy = dummy.next;
        }
        dummy.next = new Node(x, null);
        size+=1;
    }

    public int size() {
        return size;
    }
}

SLList<String> L = new SLList<>("love");
L.addFirst("I");
L.addLast("Michelle");
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    System.out.println(L.get(i));
}
```

    I
    love
    Michelle


# Arrays
- To store information, we need memory boxes, which are created when declaring variables or instantiating objects.
- Refernce types are allocated 64 bits, while primitives like int (32 bits) vary.
    - When we instantiate an objct, memory voxes are allocated for every attribute stored by that object.
- Arrays are a special kind of object that have a numbered sequence of memory boxes.
    - To get an ith item of an array `A[i]`, use `A[i]`
    - They do not have named memory boxes like classes.
    - Arrays have a fixed size.
- Arrays have a sequence of N meory boxes where N=length, such that all boxes must hold the same type and thus have the same number of bits.
    - The boxes are numbered based on 0-index.
- Only one reference is created when an array is created, if we reassign all variables containing that reference then we never get the array back.
- Arrays also do not have methods like classes.
    - "It is just a sequence of boxes"

## Creating arrays
- Arrays are almost always instantiated with new.
- Three main valid notations:


```java
int[] x = new int[3]; // Every box gets default value of 0
int[] y = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5}; // Implies length is 5
int[] z = {9, 10, 11, 12, 13};
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(z));
```

    [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]


- Two ways to copy arrays;
    - Iterate over items using a loop.
    - Using arraycopy, which takes 5 parameters:
        - Source array,
        - Source start
        - Destination array
        - Destination start
        - How many to copy.

## Java 2D arrays
- There are no 2D arrays in Java, only arrays of array references.
- Arrays and Classes are both used to organize memory boxes.
    - Array boxes are accessed using [] notation.
    - Class boxes are accessed using dot notation.
    - Array boces must be of the same type.
    - Class boxes may be of different types.
    - Both have a fixed number of boxes.
