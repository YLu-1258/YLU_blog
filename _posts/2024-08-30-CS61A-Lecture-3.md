# Control

## Print and None
- Pure functions just returns a value. None-pure functions have a side effect.
- Print is a none-pure function that always returns None, but also displays a given value.
- Practice: Implement a function h(x) that first prints, then returns, the value of f(x)



```python
def f(x):
    return print(x+1)

def h(x):
    print(f(x))
    return f(x)

def h2(x):
    y = f(x)
    print(y)
    return y
```


```python
h(2)
```

    3
    None
    3



```python
h2(2)
```

    3
    None



```python
def f(x):
    return square(x + square(y+1))

def square(z):
    y = z * z
    return y

x, y, z = 1,2,3
    
print(f(3))
```

# Multiple Environments
- Start from the earliest local frame, and trace back up in the environment until we reach the global frame.
    - A function that is defined within another function can access local parameters of the parent function.

# Control
## Conditional Statements.
- COnditional statements contain statements that may or may not be evaluated.

# Iteration
## While Statements:
- Contains stateemnts that are repeated as long as the condition is true.
    - Must eventually become a false for the statement to end (or return/break or some statement to stop iteration)
    - Entire body is executed.

# Prime Factorization
- Every positive integer n has a set of prime factors: primes whose product is n


```python
...
8 = 2 * 2 * 2
9 = 3 * 3
10 = 2 * 5
11 = 11
12 = 2 * 2 * 3
...
```

- My code:


```python
def prime_factorize(n):
    k = n
    factors = []
    curr = 2
    while (k%curr==0):
        factors.append(curr)
        k//=curr
    curr = 3
    while (curr<=n):
        while (k%curr==0):
            factors.append(curr)
            k//=curr
        curr = curr+2
    return factors

prime_factorize(1298237392)



```

Jedi's Example


```python
def prime_factors(n):
    """
    Print out all the prime factors of n
    >>> prime_factors(6)
    2
    3
    """
    # Continue to do this until n == 1
    while n != 1:
        k = smallest_factor(n) # find smallest factor of n
        print(k)
        n = n // k

def smallest_factor(n):
    """Return the smallest factor of n greater than 1."""
    k = 2
    while n % k != 0:
        k += 1
    return k

prime_factors(6)
```
