# Subtype Polymorphism Vs Function Passing
- function passing is common in python, but Java code relies more on polymorphism.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability in programming to present the same programming interface for different underlying forms.
    - Operator overloading is a form of polymorphism which allows operators to have different implementations for different types, while providing the same interface to the user.
- **Function Passing**: A function is passed as an argument into function.

## Comparables
- In Java, to compare two objects, we have to specify that object is something that can be compared.
    - How do we specify that a class has a certain capability? Use an interface.
- To compare a Dog object, we declare to Java that `Dog` is-a `Comparable`
    - Any subclass that implements `Comparable` must have the `compareTo(T o)` method.


```java
public class Dog implements Comparable<Dog> {
    public String name;
    public int size;

    public Dog(String n, int s) {
        name = n;
        size = s;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Dog other) {
        return size - other.size;
    }
}

List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<Dog>();
dogs.add(new Dog("Grigometh", 200));
dogs.add(new Dog("Pelusa", 5));
dogs.add(new Dog("Clifford", 5000));
Collections.max(dogs).name;
```




    Clifford



- Now, our Dog is something that may be compared to other dogs.
- This comparable example is called a **subtype polymorphism**.
    - A supertype (Comparable) sepcifies the capability.
    - A subtype implements the new way of how the capability works.
- "Natural Order" is used to refer to the ordering implied by a `Comparable`'s `CompareTo` method.
- What if we wanted to find the dog with the greatest alphabeticaly name?

## Comparator
- Java provides a `Comparator` interface for objects that are degiend for comparing objects.
    - We make a nested class:


```java
public class Dog implements Comparable<Dog> {
    public String name;
    public int size;

    public Dog(String n, int s) {
        name = n;
        size = s;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Dog other) {
        return size - other.size;
    }

    public static class NameComparator implements Comparator<Dog> {
        @Override
        public int compare(Dog a, Dog b) {
            return a.name.compareTo(b.name);
        }
    }
}

List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<Dog>();
dogs.add(new Dog("Grigometh", 200));
dogs.add(new Dog("Pelusa", 5));
dogs.add(new Dog("Clifford", 5000));
Collections.max(dogs, new Dog.NameComparator()).name;
```




    Pelusa



- The second argument that we passed into `Collections.max()` is an object of the type `Comparator<Dog>`.
    - In Python we pass dunctions directly
    - In Java, we package our compariso function inside of a Comparator object. We rely on on subtype polymorphism.
    - This allows us to open other ways to compare dogs.
- The following code may be more syntactically beautiful:


```java
public class Dog implements Comparable<Dog> {
    public String name;
    public int size;
    public static Comparator<Dog> NAME_COMPARATOR = new NameComparator();

    public Dog(String n, int s) {
        name = n;
        size = s;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Dog other) {
        return size - other.size;
    }

    public static class NameComparator implements Comparator<Dog> {
        @Override
        public int compare(Dog a, Dog b) {
            return a.name.compareTo(b.name);
        }
    }
}

List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<Dog>();
dogs.add(new Dog("Grigometh", 200));
dogs.add(new Dog("Pelusa", 5));
dogs.add(new Dog("Clifford", 5000));
Collections.max(dogs, Dog.NAME_COMPARATOR).name;
```




    Pelusa



## Comparables vs Comparators
- The `Comparable` interface specifies that a "natural order" exists.
    - Instances of the class can compare themselves to other objects. Only one such order is possible.
- The `Comparator` interface is used to compare extrinsically (by other classes)
    - We may have many such classes each specifying one such order.

## Writing a Generic Function
- We can create a Generic Class and then instantiate an object every time to use the methods with generics.
- However, we may also create a static generic method by specifying that the function works for objects with a type `T`, it returns a `T`, and is called `pickRandom`.


```java
public class RandomPicker {
    public static <T> T pickRandom(T[] x) {
        Random random = new Random();
        int randomIndex = random.nextInt(x.length);
        return x[randomIndex];
    }
}
```

- However, this type of implementation does not work for primitives. Primitives must have their own implementations.
- Now we may write a max function.
    - We must specify that we want not just any `T`, but a `Comparable<T>`


```java
public class Maximizer {
    public static <T extends Comparable<T>> T max(T[] items) {
        T maxItem = items[0]
    }
}
```
