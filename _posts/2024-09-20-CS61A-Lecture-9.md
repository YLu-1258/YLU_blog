# Tree Recursion
## Recursion Review
- How to Know That a Recursive Implementation is Correct:
    - **Tracing:** Diagram the whole computational process (only feasilbe for small examples/cases)
    - **Induction:** Check f(0), then check that f(n) is correct as long as f(n-1) .. f(0) are.
    - **Abstraction:** Assume f is correct (on smaller examples), then use it to implement f.
- We can also trace out program to see what functions are called and what their respective return value is.


```python
from ucb import trace

@trace
def fact(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * fact(n-1)

fact(3)
```

    fact(3):
        fact(2):
            fact(1):
                fact(0):
                fact(0) -> 1
            fact(1) -> 1
        fact(2) -> 2
    fact(3) -> 6

- Recursion is reducing down a multi-step problem down to two steps: Our current step, and then followed by trusting that the rest of the process works.


```python
def streak(n):
    """Return True if all the digits in positive integer n are the same.
    
    >>> streak(22222)
    True
    >>> streak(4)
    True
    >>> streak(2222322)
    False
    """
    return (n>=0 and n <=9) or (n>9 and (n%10 == n//10%10) and streak(n//10))

streak(2)
```




    True



## Mutual Recursion
- Two functions f and g are mutually recursive if g calls g and g calls f.



```python
def unique_prime_factors(n):
    """Return the number of unique prime factors of n.
    >>> unique_prime+factors(51)
    2
    >>> unique_prime_factors(27)
    1
    >>> unique_prime_factors(120)
    2
    """
    k = smallest_factor(n)
    print(k)
    def no_k(n):
        """Return the number of unique prime factors of n other than k"""
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        elif n % k != 0:
            
            return unique_prime_factors(n) # Recalculate k and solve. Every time we hit a different prime, call this and add 1
        else:
            return no_k(n//k) # See if k even divides again
    return 1+no_k(n)

def smallest_factor(n):
    factor = 2
    while n % factor != 0:
        factor+=1
    return factor

unique_prime_factors(12309123)
```

## Tree Recursion
### Counting Partitions
>>> The number of partitions of a positive integer n, using parts up to size m, is the number of ways in which n can be expressed as the sum of positive integer parts up to m.




```python
def count_partitions(n, m):
    if (n == 0): # Happens when n == m, count partitions is called when n = 0, which should return a total of 1 ways of getting the number
        return 1
    elif n < 0: # if m is bigger than n, it is impossible to count to n with m
        return 0
    elif m == 0: # How many ways to get to n with 0 numbers??? 0!!!!
        return 0
    else:
        with_m = count_partitions(n-m, m)
        without_m = count_partitions(n, m-1)
        return with_m + without_m
    
count_partitions(6,4)
```

# Spring 2023 Midterm 2 Question 5
- Definition. When parking vehicles in a row, a motercycle takes up 1 parking spot and a car takes up 2 adjacent parking spots. A string of length n can represent n adjacent parking spots using % for a motocycle, <> for a car, and . for an enpty spot.

>>> Implement count_park, which returns the number of ways that vehicles can be parked in n adjacent parking spots for positive integer n. Some or all spots can be empty.


```python
def count_park(n):
    """Count the ways to park cars and motocycles in n adjacent spots.
    >>> count_park(1)
    2
    >>> count_park(2)
    """
    if n < 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return 2*count_park(n-1) + 1*count_park(n-2)
    
count_park(4)
```
