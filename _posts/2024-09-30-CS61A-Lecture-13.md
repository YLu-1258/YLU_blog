# Data Abstraction
- Not inherently implemented within the python interpreter. A set of behaviors defined by the programmer.
    - We may refer to the data and the parts without any worry about how they are implemented.
- We do this because the code becomes easier to revist and revise. We many edit features at each level of abstraction without any contradictions or mistakes to other prtions of the program.
- Ex: Line




```python
def line(slope, intercept):
    return lambda x: slope * x + intercept

def slope(f):
    return f(1)-f(0)

def y_intercept(f):
    return f(0)

#### Abstraction barrier
#### We do not directly refer to the line type, or how it is implemented.
def parallel(f, g):
    return slope(f) == slope(g)

def increasing(f):
    return slope(f) > 0

f = line(3,5)
g = line(3, 10)
print("slope:", slope(f))
print("line value at 2:", 2)
print("are parallel?", parallel(f, g))
print("are increasing?", increasing(f))
```

    slope: 3
    line value at 2: 2
    are parallel? True
    are increasing? True


# Trees
## Tree Abstraction
- A tree is a hierarchical abstraction to contain data.
    - A general data structure. can contain numbers, letters, etc.
    - The tree can be categorized into branches and roots. 
        - Every branch has a root.
        - Every branch is a tree.
        - A tree with no branches is called a leaf
        - A tree starts at the root
    - A tree can also be described relatively
        - Every location in a tree is called a node
        - Each node as a lable that can be any value
        - One node can be the parent/child of another
        - The top node is the root node
    - A path is a collection of nodes that enable us to travel from one root node to another child node.

## Using the Tree Abstraction
- For a tree t, you can only:
    - Get the label for the root of the tree: `label(t)`
    - Get the list of branches for the tree: `branches(t)`
    - Get the branch at an index i, which is a tree: `branches(t)[i]`
    - Determine whether the tree is a leaf: `is_leaf(t)`
    - Treat t as a value: `return t`, `f(t)`, `[t]`, `s=t`


```python
from tree import *
tree(3, [tree(1), tree(2, [tree(1), tree(1)])])
u = tree(3, [tree(4, [tree(5)]), tree(7)])
print(label(branches(u)[1]))
print(label(branches(branches(u)[0]))[0])
```

# Tree Processing Uses Recursion
- We always use recursion to interpret or traverse a tree.


```python
def count_leaves(t):
    """Count the leaves of a tree."""
    if is_leaf(t):
        return 1
    else:
        branch_counts = [count_leaves(b) for b in branches(t)]
        return sum(branch_counts)
```

## Writing Recursive Functions
- What recursive calls will you make?
- What type of values do they return?
- What do the possible return values mean?
- How can you use those return values to complete your implementation?


```python
def largest_label(t):
    """Return the largest label in tree t."""
    if is_leaf(t):
        return label(t)
    else:
        return max([largest_label(b) for b in branches(t)] + [label(t)])
    
t1 = tree(3, [tree(4, [tree(5)]), tree(7), tree(1)])
largest_label(t1)
```

```python
def above_root(t):
    """print all the lavels of t that are larger tan the root label."""
    def process(u):
        if label(u) > label(t):
            print(label(u))
        for b in branches(u):
            process(b)
    process(t)

above_root(t1)
```
