# Dogs
- Below is an example of a Dog class, and a launcher class that invokes methods from the Dog class.
- However, not all dogs are created equal, dogs may have different behaviors.


```java
public class Dog {
    public static void makeNoise() {
        System.out.println("bark");
    }
}

public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog.makeNoise();
    }
}

DogLauncher.main(null);
```

    bark


# Object Instantiation
- Classes can contain not just functions, but also different data.
    - For example, we may update the Dog class to contain additional data.
- Using a class, we may instantiate a method.
- There are **static (instance)** and **non-static (class)** attributes and methods.
    - If an instance needs to access a method, that method must be non static.
- New instance variables cannot be added to a class or object. It must obey the blueprints.
- If a created object is not assigned, in Java it is garbage collected, meaning it is destroyed.



```java
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds; // This is an instance variable. It is not static

    // This is a constructor that is ran when the object is created.
    public Dog(int s) {
        weightInPounds = s;
    }

    // This is an instance method
    public void makeNoise() {
        if (weightInPounds > 20) {
            System.out.println("aroooooo!");
        } else if (weightInPounds > 10) {
            System.out.println("bark");
        } else {
            System.out.println("yipyipyip");
        }
        
    }
}

public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog maya = new Dog(25); // Declaration, Instantiation, and Assignment
        maya.makeNoise();
    }
}

DogLauncher.main(null);
```

    aroooooo!


## Array of Objects
- To create an array, we use the new keyword.
    - To add objects to the array, we use new for each object that we want to add into the array.


```java
Dog[] dogArray = new Dog[5];
dogArray[0] = new Dog(20);
System.out.println(dogArray.toString());
```

    [LREPL.$JShell$12I$Dog;@64052435


# Static vs Non-static
- The key differences between static and non-static (instance) methods:
    - Static methods are invoked using the class name: (i.e. Dog.makeNoise();)
    - Instance methods are invoked using an instnace name (i.e. maya,makeNoise();)
    - Static methods cannot access any instance variables as it doesn't know which instance to access.
    - Non-static memebrs cannot be invoked using class name.
- We have static methods because some classes are never instantiated like Math.


```java
Math.round(5.6);
```

- We now add a static method to our dog class.


```java
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds; // This is an instance variable. It is not static

    // This is a constructor that is ran when the object is created.
    public Dog(int s) {
        weightInPounds = s;
    }

    // This is an instance method
    public void makeNoise() {
        if (weightInPounds > 20) {
            System.out.println("aroooooo!");
        } else if (weightInPounds > 10) {
            System.out.println("bark");
        } else {
            System.out.println("yipyipyip");
        }
        
    }

    public static Dog maxDog(Dog d1, Dog d2) {
        if (d1.weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds) {
            return d1;
        }
        return d2;
    }
}

public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog maya = new Dog(25); // Declaration, Instantiation, and Assignment
        Dog hugeGreg = new Dog(1500);
        Dog largerDog = Dog.maxDog(maya, hugeGreg);
        largerDog.makeNoise();
    }
}

DogLauncher.main(null);
```

    aroooooo!


## Static Variables are Dangerous
- Do not have a static variable that changes.

## Static vs Final
- `static`: It is universal.
- `final`: it doesn't change.


```java
public class Dog {
    public int weightInPounds; // This is an instance variable. It is not static
    public static String binomen = "Canis familiaris"; // This is a static variable. It is shared across all dogs.

    // This is a constructor that is ran when the object is created.
    public Dog(int s) {
        weightInPounds = s;
    }

    // This is an instance method
    public void makeNoise() {
        if (weightInPounds > 20) {
            System.out.println("aroooooo!");
        } else if (weightInPounds > 10) {
            System.out.println("bark");
        } else {
            System.out.println("yipyipyip");
        }
        
    }

    public static Dog maxDog(Dog d1, Dog d2) {
        if (d1.weightInPounds > d2.weightInPounds) {
            return d1;
        }
        return d2;
    }
}

public class DogLauncher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog maya = new Dog(25); // Declaration, Instantiation, and Assignment
        Dog hugeGreg = new Dog(1500);
        Dog largerDog = Dog.maxDog(maya, hugeGreg);
        largerDog.makeNoise();
    }
}

DogLauncher.main(null);
```

# List
- A list is an ordered sequence of objects represented by comma-separated values in-between brackets.
    - Ex: [3,6,9,12,15]
- Lists support many operations that are detailed by the programming language itself.
    - Adding (appending) to a list.
    - Inserting to a list.
    - Removing from a list.
    - Retrieving from a list.
    - etc.
- Using a list in Java:
    - The `List` class is abstract, so it may not be instantiated. We must use an Array-based list or someting else.


```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ListDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List L = new ArrayList();
        L.add("a");
        L.add("b");
        L.add("c");
        System.out.println(L);
    }
}

ListDemo.main(null);
```

    [a, b, c]


- We may also use a linked list


```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class ListDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List L = new LinkedList();
        L.add("a");
        L.add("b");
        L.add("c");
        System.out.println(L.get(0));
    }
}

ListDemo.main(null);
```

    a


- Java has a lot of lists, and a programmer must decide what list they want to use.

## Abstract Data Types vs Concrete Data Types
- In Java, a List is an abstract class, meaning that all lists share the properties of List.
- We have many different concrete Data Types because different lists have different properties that make them better at certain things.
    - Ex: A stack based list has "push" and "pop" operations.

## Specified Data Types for Collections.
- We may specify what type our list stores using the angled-bracket syntax.


```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class ListDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List L = new LinkedList();
        L.add("a");
        L.add("b");
        L.add("c");
        String a = L.get(0); // This fails
    }
}

ListDemo.main(null);
```


    |           L.add("a");

    unchecked call to add(E) as a member of the raw type java.util.List

    

    |           L.add("b");

    unchecked call to add(E) as a member of the raw type java.util.List

    

    |           L.add("c");

    unchecked call to add(E) as a member of the raw type java.util.List

    

    |           String a = L.get(0); // This fails

    incompatible types: java.lang.Object cannot be converted to java.lang.String

    



```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class ListDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> L = new LinkedList();
        L.add("a");
        L.add("b");
        L.add("c");
        String a = L.get(0); // This works
    }
}

ListDemo.main(null);
```

- Thus, this syntax constrains list to only have one certain type instead of many.

# Arrays
- Java has a special collection called an srray that is a restricted version of the list.
    - The size must be declared at the time the array is created.
    - Size cannot change
    - All items muste of the same type.
    - No methods.
- No python equivalent.
- Arrays are typically more performany than lists.

# Maps
- A map is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is guaranteed to be unique.
- Ex: Java


```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class MapDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, String> L = new TreeMap<>();
        L.put("dog", "woof");
        L.put("cat", "meow");
        String sound = L.get("cat");
    }
}

MapDemo.main(null);
```
