# Sequences
- Lists are a built-in Python data type.
    - We can initialize a list and access elements within it with the square brackets ([]) syntax 
    - Python arrays are based on the 0-index. 1st element has an index of 0.
- Builtin functions can also be evaluated on lists
    - `len()` returns the number of leements in the list.
        - `len()` can be used to access elements (`list[len(lst) - 1]`)
    - `in` is an infix operator that returns `True` if an element is found in a list, and `False` otherwise.
        - It must match the value exactly.


```python
lst = [1, 8, 2, 8]
print("First Element:",lst[0])
print("Array Length:", len(lst))
print("Last Object in list:", lst[len(lst) - 1])
print("Is 1 in list?", 1 in lst)
print("Is [1, 8] in list?", [1, 8] in lst)
```

    First Element: 1
    Array Length: 4
    Last Object in list: 8
    Is 1 in list? True
    Is [1, 8] in list? False
    1


- There is an order of operations when evaluating operators.
    - Ex: `1 or 8 in lst`
        - The `or` keyword gets evaluated first, 1 returns true, so `8 in lst` never gets evaluated.
- Lists also have arithmetic operations
    - Concatentation: `[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
    - Multiply a list: `[1, 2, 3] * 2 = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`

# For Loop
- The for loop may be used to iterate over a set/collection/range of values.
    - `for <dummy_var> in <range>:`
    - Try not to delete elements while in a for loop, we can have an `ConcurrentRemovalException`
    - The dummy variable that we use in a for loop is also a local variable in the frame where the for loop is being run. It is being consecutively updated by each element of the range.
        - After the loop, the variable persists.



```python
for elem in lst:
    print(elem)
```

    1
    8
    2
    8



```python
def f(x):
    for y in [x, x+1, x+2]: # Values are evaluated [10, 11, 12] not [10, 10+1, 10+2]
        print('this is y:', y)
        if y > 0:
            return y
    return 1000

f(0)
```

    this is y: 0
    this is y: 1





    1



# Ranges
- <mark>Range:</mark>  A range is a sequence of consecutive integers.
    - Contains every number from the start number inclusive, to the end number, excusive.
    - The length is the ending value - starting value.
        - This is why the end index is exvluded.
    - A range is not a list, we would convert it into a list using `list()`
        - The `list()` function converts a sequence into a list. If only a list is passed into the function, then it will just return the list.
            - The input has to be an iterable.
    - Element selection: starting value + index
- Default starting value is 0.



```python
a = range(-2, 2)
print(type(a))
a = list(a)
print(type(a))
a
```

    <class 'range'>
    <class 'list'>





    [-2, -1, 0, 1]



# List Comprehensions
- [<map expr> for <dummy_var> in <sequence> if <condition>]


```python
lst = list(range(1,6))
even_numbers = [elem for elem in lst if elem % 2 == 0]
even_numbers
```




    [2, 4]



## Example:
- Given these two related lists of the same length:
    - xs = range(-10,11)
    - ys = [x*x - 2*x+ 1 for x in xs]
- Return all values in xs, such that the corresponding value in ys is less than 10.


```python
xs = range(-10,11)
ys = [x*x - 2*x+ 1 for x in xs]
xs_where_y_is_below_10 = [i for i in xs if i*i - 2*i + 1 < 10 ]
xs_where_y_is_below_10_with_ys = [xs[i] for i in range(len(xs)) if ys[i] < 10]
print(xs)
print(ys)
print(xs_where_y_is_below_10)
print(xs_where_y_is_below_10_with_ys)
```

    range(-10, 11)
    [121, 100, 81, 64, 49, 36, 25, 16, 9, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
    [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]



```python

```
