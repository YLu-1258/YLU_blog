# Welcome to CSA!
Today was my first week in APCSP! I am so excited to learn more about the Java language and computer progrmming and hopefully I can successfully apply the things and knowledge I learn to the next USACO competition in December. I also hope to continue to use my knowledge to help my undergraduate research projects if I do go to college.  

## Linux Shell
The first thing that I did when I got into the class was to download a wsl instance to create my coding environment
 - I created a new user
 - I set up critical tools such as ruby and java to establish the development environment for my blog
 - I set up my jupyter notebooks to work with both IPython and IJava kernels.
 - I created a unique blog of my own with the Chirpy theme. Though it looks crisp, there is still much to be done!
