# Takeaways
Here are some main takeaways that I took for myself in today's alumni panel meeting. My reflection of the event is below in the blog.  

Collin Szeto -> Clas of 2021, Mech E at UCSD, utilized teamwork strategies such as scrum teams and agile development.  
Tristan Copley -> Works at LG currently, study at Miramar college  
Mabel Szeto -> Cog Sci at UCSD, machine learning and neural computation  
Anthony Vo -> UCI Computer Science BS. Also minored in Quantitative finance? Worked at Code Ninjas to teach kids how to code.  


## College Process
> Did you have a particular strategy or approach when selecting colleges or universittes to apply to for computer science programs? What factors did you consider?

UCSD Computer science program is largely a lottery. Some also apply only to community college to transfer to a better college down the line. Do more applications to increase your chances of success. UCSD has very strong cog sci, eng. and CS programs. CS is extremely hard to switch into in university. It is a heavily impacted major. Data Science and cog sci are more niche, but that's only if you don't polann on doing aynthign in CS. UCSD has a lot of professors that work on machine learning, such as language transformers and such. If you find a professor that you really like, then apply to that school in hopes of workoing with that person. 

> Were there any computer science-related extracurricular activities or projects from high school that you highlighted in your college applications?

Any extracurricular activities that show a dedication to coding or computer science would be a good addition to the application. Additionally, tutoring activites in particular are effective at showing off your skills. Extracurriculars such as CP are also critical. Organizing events and leading projects to show off your leadership is especially effective in painting yourself as a good applicant. Could also state the leadership stuff in the interviews. Talk more about your project in these interviews, show your impact and the passion that you have for this field. 

> A common supplemental question for college apps is why *this* major. What major do you want to major in computer science?

Just overall applications of CS can span from any field and allow you freedom to explore the other crafts.

## Internships
> Tell us about the application/interview process  
Building different projects and personal wbesites could really help with finding an interview for an intership. Just build a bunch of projects, does not necessariy have to complete in order to have an impact on them. Can also use any connections that you have. When you build a project, reploy it on some platform, such as AWS or vercel, in order to be able to send the link to someone to show them what you are capable of. Show your personal projects, class projects, and also other things to these people that are looking for new hires. Must have something tangible and something to show for.  

Find an event or internship that you really like, then find something that they have already done, then do a study on just that thing, and just create something to show for it. Show a mock of it, and show how you would change it and why you would change it. Create a lot of documentation. Show it off on personal blog as well as github profile and repositories. Do things that you enjoy. Build something that you enjoy messing with. 

> Could each of you share a bit about your internship experiences and how they have shaped your career paths or educational journeys? What was expected of you at your internship, what did you accomplish? 

Grind hella leetcode to get ready for the first round of the interview. Be good at solving problems so show that you are different from the rest of the crowd. Collin and Mabel applied to HIP and eventually got internships at Northrop Grumman.

> What skills from DN Computer Science classes helped you land your internship  

There are different scripting skills that could help with the process. One in particular is to convert different file formats

## Personal Projects
> Tell use something about college experience so far (in your STEM classes). Has it been harder tha nyou expected? Easier?

Being experienced in linux has been of great help in the robotics classes, where they were able to train their neural networks on the operating system. Study the differnet tools in CS to use, it will give you plenty opportunities and boosts. (Vercel, Svelt-kit). Code up a personal powers. Pick up on the new tools and novel innovations to use. This sets you apart from the rest of the coworkers.

# Reflection

When it comes to selecting colleges for computer science programs, it's crucial to diversify my options. UCSD's Computer Science program, like many others, can be highly competitive, so cast a wide net by applying to multiple schools. I can consider community college as a stepping stone to transfer to a more prestigious institution. UCSD does have strong programs, but switching into computer science can be tough due to its popularity. I shouldn't limit myself and should instead explore niche fields like data science or cognitive science if they align with my interests. I will also research with professors whose work resonates with me and target schools where I could potentially collaborate with them. In my college applications, I should emphasize my dedication to coding through extracurricular activities and coding competitions and showcase my leadership skills through organizing events and projects. During interviews, I will delve into my projects, emphasizing their impact and my passion for the field. When asked about my major choice, highlight the versatility of computer science, explaining how it spans various disciplines and offers the freedom to explore different crafts. It's also important remember to apply widely, leverage personal connections, and showcase my skills through tangible projects and websites when seeking internships, as these experiences can shape my career path and set me apart in the competitive world of computer science. In my computer science classes, focus on acquiring scripting skills and explore various tools in the field to boost my opportunities and gain an edge in the STEM landscape.
