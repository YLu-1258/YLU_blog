## List Comprehension practice

### First in Line
- Implement **promoted**, which takes a sequence **s** and a one-argument function **f**. It returns a list with the same elements as **s**, but with all elements **e** for which **f(e)** is a true value ordered first. Among those placed first and those placed after, the order stays the same.
- For list comprehensions, a new frame is opened for iterating over the values in a sequence.


```python
def promoted(s,f):
    """
    Return a list with the same elements as s, but with all elements e for which f(e) is a true value placed first
    """
    return [elem for elem in s if f(elem)] + [elem for elem in s if not f(elem)]

odd = lambda x: x % 2 == 1
promoted(range(10), odd)
```




    [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8]



## Strings
- Strings are also considered as sequences.


```python
s = "hello"
print(s[0])
print(list(s))
```

    h
    ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']


# Box-and-Pointer Notation in Environment Diagrams
- Lists are represented as a row of index-labeled adjacent boxes, one per element
- Each box either contains a primitive value or pints to a compound value

# Slicing
- We can take a partition and create a copy of said list. Any changes to the copy of the list does not affect  the state of the original list.
- If the starting element is creater than the beginning element in list splicing, then an empty list is displayed


```python
s = [2, 3, 4, 5]
t = s[:]
t[0] = 1
print(s)
t = s
t[0] = 1
print(s)

```

    [2, 3, 4, 5]
    [1, 3, 4, 5]


## Implementing double_eights
- Use a list of numbers as our input this time around.


```python
def double_eights(s):
    if (s[:2] == [8, 8]):
        return True
    elif len(s) < 2:
        return False
    else:
        return double_eights(s[1:])

double_eights([2, 8, 4, 6, 8, 2])
```




    False




```python
all([x > 10 for x in range(20, 30)])
```




    True
