# Assignment Expressions
- To retrieve a lost built in function, just restore its original functionality by setting it to its name under the `__builtins__` class.



```python
max = __builtins__.max
```

# Environment Diagrams
- We may draw out how the program is executed by python.
## Calling User-Defined Functions
Steps:
1. Add a local frame, creating a new environment
2. Find function's formal parameters to the arguments in that grame
3. Edecute the body of the function within the new environment

- The code of the function itself is not called until the function itself is called with an argument.
- For this class, we only open new frames for the user-defined function.
- The function's dignature has all the info we need to create a local frame

## Looking Up Names in Environments
- Every expression is evalated in the context of an environment.
- When we refer to a frame as being "early" it is the one at the bottom of our environmental diagram.
- The global frame is always the last frame that we look at.
- An environment always comprises of the frame in which another screen is being executed.

## Search Problem
- Try a bunch of options to see which one is the best
    - Computers are really good at this
