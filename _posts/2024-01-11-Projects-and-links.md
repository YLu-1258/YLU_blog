# Below are the set of links for my past projects and lessons
| Project | Link | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Dijkstra visualization | https://csa-tri-1.github.io/DADDiJkstra-frontend/pages/app | We created an app to demonstrate how dijkstra works in a graph representation of nodes |
| Tri 1 Scrum board | https://github.com/orgs/CSA-Tri-1/projects/3 | This is a scrum board to demonstrate our team work with my group in Tri 1 |
| Dijkstra visualization frontend repo | https://github.com/CSA-Tri-1/DADDiJkstra-frontend | This was David and I's experimentation with other frontend frameworks and technologies. We found tailwindCSS and daisyUI to be good, perhaps even better, substitutes for bootstrap. |
| Dijkstra visualization backend repo | https://github.com/CSA-Tri-1/DADDJbackend | This was the backend that I worked on with Drew in Tri 1. I implementied the Dijkstra's algorithm to our backend, while Drew and I worked on making our endpoints work. |
| Sorting project runtime | https://dea-frontend.vercel.app | Here is the runtime link to our sorting algorithms project. |
| Frontend project for Sorting | https://github.com/CSA-Tri-2/DEA-frontend | This was the frontend site that we had for our sorting algorithms project |
| Backend project for Sorting | https://github.com/CSA-Tri-2/DEA-project | This was the backend repo that we had for our sorting algorithms project, where we made it very modular to add additional sorting algorithms |
| Set of issues for Sorting | https://github.com/CSA-Tri-2/DEA-project/issues | Here are the set of issues that we had for the DEA project. This could demonstrate our teamwork as we worked through our project |
| Set of issues for Tri 2 | https://github.com/CSA-Tri-2/CSA-Tri-2/issues | This is the current set of issues that we rely on for our organization, we plan on migrating to another organization with all 6 team members for our review |
| Tri 2-3 project scrumboard | https://github.com/orgs/CSA-AI/projects/1 | This is the new scrumboard I had just set up yesterday for our group work thorughout tri 2 and 3. There isn't much yet, but it will be filled up quickly.
