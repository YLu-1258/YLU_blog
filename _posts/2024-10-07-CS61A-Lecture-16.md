# Generators
- An iterable is any sequence we can iterate over (we may clal iter() on the iterator and get an iterator)
- An iterator allows us to iterate over any iterable sequence (we can call next() on it and get the next item in the sequence)
    - iter()
    - enumerate()
    - map()
    - zip()
    - range()


```python
from tree import *
def exclude(t, x):
    filtered_branches = map(lambda y: exclude(y, x), branches(t))
    bs = []
    for b in filtered_branches:
        if label(b) == x:
            bs.extend(branches(b))
        else:
            bs.append(b)
    return tree(label(t), bs)

t = tree(1, [tree(2, [tree(2), tree(3), tree(4)]), tree(5, [tree(1)])])
exclude(t, 2)
```




    [1, [3], [4], [5, [1]]]
