# B-Trees
- BSTs can either be bushy or spindly.
  - A spindly BST tree is slow to access elements. Similar to a linked list. $O(N)$ time for accessing elements.
  - A bushy BST is fast to access elements, $O(\log N)$ time to access elements.
- This motivates us to construct a "Balancing-Tree", a tree that always attempts to maintain a bushy structure.
> Note about Big-Theta versus Big-O. Big Theta is typically more informative than Big O as it restricts us to one family of functions. Something that is O(N) could also be O(N^2). The upper bound can keep going up without consequence.

## B-Tree Operations
- BST performance is reliant on Height and Depth
  - **Height:** The depth of the deepest leaf and is that tree-wide property.
  - **Depth:** The distance from the root of a node and is node-specific.
  - **Average Depth:** The mean of the depth of every node.
- The core-concept behind a B-Tree is the ability to overstuff the leaf nodes.
  - If we can avoid it, we do not add a new node but rather stick the new value into an existing leaf node at some determined location.

- The problem with overstuffing is that with sufficiently enough items in a node, searchign sequentially within a node requires linear search.

### Moving items up.
- Once a node becomes saturated with enough values, we may move up a value to the parent node.
  - For simplicity, we always move the middle element.
  - However, this may cause an issue where there exists values smaller than the moved value to the right of the moved element:

    - In this case, the value of 16 is greater than 17, but it is still to the right of 17. This breaks the BST property.
- To address this, we create many children for each parent overstuffed parent node.

- In the above example, we have nodes representing intervals for $(-\infty, 15), [15,17], (17, +\infty)$
- We can set some constant $L$ as the limit on our node size.
  - This would make our search time increase only by a constant factor, so we preserve our asymptotic behavior.
- When we add a node, we may cause a chain reaction where parent nodes successively split.

- A B-Tree can have different names based on the number of children it may have in a node.
  - We work with 2-3 trees, which contains a limit of 2 items per node, where each node can have 2 or three children.

## B-Tree Usage
- B-Trees are used for two main contexts
  - We use a small L for self-balancing search trees.
  - We use a large L in the thousands for databses and filesystems.
- The construction of a B-Tree grants it two invariants:
  - All leaves are the same distance from the root.
  - A non-leaf node with k items must have exactly k+1 children.
- This guaratees us a B-Tree with $\log N$ height
# B-Tree Runtime Analysis
- let $L$ be the maximum items per node and $N$ be the number of items. The maximum height should be $\log_{L+1} N$ in the best case when all nodes have $L$ items and $\log_{2}N$ worst case when each node has 1 item.
  - Overall height is on the order of $\Theta (\log N)$

## Runtime for `contains`
- Worst case forces us to look at up to $L$ items per node, but since height is logarithmic, the runtime of `contains` is bounded by $O(L \log N)$. This tells use that the runtime of `contains` is $O(\log N)$ 
## Runtime for `add`
- The logic for `add` is similar to `contains` except `add` might break up certain nodes. The act of breaking up nodes results in doing $\log N$  additional split operations. THus means that the runtime of `add` is still $O(\log N)$
