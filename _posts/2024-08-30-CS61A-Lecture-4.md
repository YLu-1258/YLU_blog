# Designing Functions
- A function's *domain* is the set of all inputs it might possibly take as arguments.
    - A function's *range* is the set of output values it might possibly return
- A pure function's *behavior* is the relationship it establishes between the input and output.
- Good programmer practice: Implement a process only once and do not repeat it many times.


```python
# same_length.py
def digits(a, b):
    a_digits = 0
    while a > 0:
        a = a // 10
        a_digits = a_digits + 1
    return a_digits

def same_length(a,b):
    return digits(a) == digits(b)
```

# Higher Order Functions
- Functions can be passed as parameters to another function.
- Summation Example


```python
def cube(k):
    return pow(k, 3)

def summation(n, term):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + term(k), k+1
    return total

summation(5, cube)
```

## Program Design
- Modularity: Simple objects can be combined to create more complex operations
- Abstraction: We can hide complex operations behind a name and trust that it works every time.
- Separation of Concerns (??)

## Functions are Return values
- Locally Defined Functions
    - Functions that are defined within other function bodies are bound to names in a local frame

## Twenty-One Game
- Example:


```python
def play(strategy0, strategy1, goal=21):
    n = 0
    who = 0
    while n < goal:
        if who == 0:
            n = n + strategy0()
            who = 1
        elif who == 1:
            n = n + strategy1()
            who = 0
    return who

def three_strategy():
    return 3

play(three_strategy, three_strategy)
```
