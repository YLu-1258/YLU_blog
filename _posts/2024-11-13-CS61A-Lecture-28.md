# Interpreters
- The scheme interpreter represents expressions as Pairs.
    - For the operands, we must evaluate each of the values individually. This is because we may have compound expressions, where operands themselves may be expressions,
- Within an interpreter, we have an `eval` and an `apply`
    - `eval`: evaluates values and expressions
    - `apply`: Applies operands to an operator
- Both eval and apply may call each other. Eval requires a working environment, Apply needs to create an environment.

## Eval
- Base cases:
    - Primitive values (numbers)
    - Look up values in the environment bound to symbols
- Recursive calls:
    - Eval(operator, operands) of call expressions
    - Apply(procedure, arguments)
    - Eval(sub-expressions) of special forms

## Apply
- Base cases: 
    - Built-in primitive procedures
- Recursive calls:
    - Eval(body) of user-defined procedures

## Steps of an interpreter
- **Tokenization/Parsing**: Converts text ito Python representation of Scheme expressions:
    - Numbers are represented as numbers
    - Symbols are represented as strings
    - Lists are represented as instances of the Pair class
- **Evaluation**: Converts scheme expressions to values while executing side effects.
- Ex: Return the symbol of a define expression



```python
def symbol(exp):
    assert exp.first == 'define' and exp.rest is not nil and exp.rest.rest is not nil
    signature = exp.rest.first
    if scheme_symboolp(signature):
        return signature
    else:
        return signature.first
```

# Scehem Evaluation
- The `scheme+eval` function chooses behavior based on expression form:
    - Symbols are looked up in the current environment
    - Self-evaluating expressions are returned as values
    - All other legal expressions are represented as Scheme lists, called combinations

# Lambda Expressions
- Lambda expressions evaluate to user-defined procedures
    - `(lambda (formal parameters) (<body>))`
- It is represented in Python through a `LambdaProcedure` class.


```python
class LambdaProcedure:
    def __init__(self, formals, body, env):
        self.formals = formals # A scheme list of symbols
        self.body = body # A scheme list of expressions
        self.env = env # A frame instance
```

# Frames and Environments
- A frame represents an environment by having a parent frame
- Frames are Python intsnace with methods `lookup` and `define`


```python
g = Frame(None)
f = Frame(g)
g.define('y', 3)
g.define('z', 5)
f.define('x', 2)
f.define('z', 4)
g.lookup('y') # 3
f.lookup('x') # 2
f.lookup('z') # 4
```
