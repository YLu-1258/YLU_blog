# SELECT statements
- A SELECT statement specifies an input table using `FROM [table]`
    - `SELECT [columns] FROM [table] WHERE [condition] ORDER BY [order];`
    - `SELECT [expression] AS [name], [expression] AS name;`
    - We can optionally use `[column] AS [name]` to rename the input column in our new table.
    - Column descriptions determine how each input row is projected to a result row.
    - A subset of the rows can be selected (i.e. filtered) using `WHERE [condition]`
    - An ordering can be declared using `ORDER BY [column]`
- To save the subset of the table we generate using select, we must concatenate the select statement to the `CREATE TABLE [name]` statement using `AS`.
    - `CREATE TABLE [name] AS [SELECT statement]`
- To Generate a table by stupid brute force:


```python
CREATE TABLE [name] AS
SELECT [value] AS [column name], [value] AS [column name] UNION
SELECT [VALUE], [value] UNION
SELECT [VALUE], [value];
```

# Joining two tables
- Tables `A` & `B` are joined by a comma (or JOIN) to form a new table of all the combinations of the rows of A with the rows of B
- To format these new tables to reduce ambiguity (duplicate table names) we may assign an alias to each column name.


```python
SELECT 
A.column1 as a_col1,
A.column2 as a_col2,
B.column1 as b_col1,
B.column2 as b_col2,
FROM A, B;
```

# Adding to a table
- We use the `INSERT INTO` statement to new rows into a table.


```python
INSERT INTO [table name] VALUES ([value for col1], [value for col2])
```

# Joining a table with itself
- To join a table with itself, (to create combinations of our original data) we use aliases to distinguish between the same columns of the same table.


```python
SELECT [alias1].[column] as [name1], [alias2].[column] as [name2],
FROM [table name] as [alias1], [table name] as [alias2],
WHERE [CONDITION]
```


```python
SELECT parent from parents, dogs WHERE child = name AND fur = "curly"
```

- Expressions may contain function calls and arithmetic operators
    - Combine valiues: +, -, *, /, %, and, or
    - Transformvalues: abs, round
    - Compare values: <, <=, >, >=, =
- String avlues can be combined to form longer strings
