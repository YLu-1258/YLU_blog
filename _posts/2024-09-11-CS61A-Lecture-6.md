# Lecture


## Zero-Argument Functions
- Yes, functions can take 0 arguments.
- Functions always re-evaluate their bodies when called.

## Dice Functions
- In the Hog project, dice are functions that are zero-argument functions.
- IMplement `repeat()` which is a function that returns the # of times in n rolls that an outcome repeat



```python
def repeats(n, dice):
	count = 0
	prev = None
	while n :
		outcome = dice()
		if outcome == prev:
			count += 1
		prev = outcome
		n -= 1
	return count

repeats(20, six_sided)
```

## Higher Order Functions
- Functions are not allowed to change the value of a name associated within another frame. The name will not update in the higher frame.



```python
def reprint(n):
    def a(word):
        k = n
        while k:
            print(word)
            k-=1
    return a

twice = reprint(2)
twice('hey')
```

    hey
    hey
