title: Individual seed review
---
## 100%
Last trimester, I have received a >93% grade and have also demonstrated teamwork within our team. For the most part, we used live-share to collaborate on our LSTM features and also used slack as the main communication platform across periods. 

## 90%
### Individual Progress
Over the past two trimesters, I believe that I have done a good job at partiipating and contributing to the project. The following are are screenshots providing proof for my claim:

### GitHub Pages Blog
Throughout the trimester, I frequently used my blog to update and record my progress through the class and progress.

### AP Work
I have also been consistent with the FRQs and their applications to our PBL, the link to my issue can be found [here](https://github.com/YLu-1258/YLU_blog/issues/9). Additionally, the individual links to the FRQs can be found at this these links:

### Project Work
Throughout this last trimester, I have been coordinating overall group tasks and duties with David on our project board.
