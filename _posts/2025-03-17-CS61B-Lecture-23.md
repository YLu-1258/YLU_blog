# BFS, DFS, Graph Traversals and Implementations
- To implement any graph algorithms like DFS, we need:
    - An **API** (Application Programming Interface) for graphs.
        - Defines a set of protocols for how Graph programmers must think.
    - A concrete data structure to represent graphs.

## Graph API
- Common Convention: We have number nodes assigned to each node, and use numbers throughout the graph implementation.
    - Looking up a vertex by label needs a `Map<Label, Integer>`


```java
public class Graph {
    public Graph(int V):                // Create empty grpah with v vertices
    public void addEdge(int v; int w):  // Adds an edge v-w
    Iterable<Integer> adj(int v):       // vertices adjacent to v
    int V():                            // number of vertices
    int E():                            // number of edges
}
```

- Restrictions about our class
    - Number of vertices must be specified in advance
    - Does not support weights or labels on nodes or edges.
    - Has no method for getting the number of edges for a vertex (the degree of a vertex).


```java
public static int degree(Graph G, int v) {
    int degree = 0;
    for (int u : graph.adj(v)) {
        degree++;
    }
    return degree;
}

public static void print(Graph G) {
    for (int v; v < G.V(); v++) {
        for (int u : G.adj(u)) {
            // Print each edge once
            if (u > v) {
                System.out.println(v + " - " + u);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Depth First Search Implementations
- We create a wrapper class for a graph for the operations that we want to perform operations on.
    - We have a specialized class for each type of question that we want to address
    - Ex: Paths.
        - We create a graph object
        - Pass the graph to a graph-processing method (or constructor) in a client class.
        - Query te client class for information.


```java
public class Paths {
    public Paths(Graph G, int s):
    boolean hasPathTo(int v):
    Iterable<Integer> pathTo(int v):
}
```

- This wrapper class has access to the underlaying graph structure, but we may add another layer of abstraction by adding more helper methods.
- Recall s-t Connectivity
    - connected(s, t):
        - Mark s.
        - Does s == t? If so, return true.
        - Otherwise, if connected(v,t) for any unmarked neighbor v or s, return true.
        - Return false.


```java
public class DepthFirstPaths {
    private boolean[] marked;
    private int[] edgeTo;
    private int s;

    public DepthFirstPaths(Graph G, int s) {
        // Create a data structure for our graph G
        dfs(G, s);
    }

    private void dfs(Graph G, int v) {
        // Mark the current vertex as visited
        marked[v] = true;
        for (int w: G.adj(v)) {
            // Visit each unmarked vertex w
            if (!marked[w]) {
                // Set our vertex as the neighbor of w
                edgeTo[w] = v;
                // Recurse on w
                dfs(G, w)
            }
        }
    }

    public boolean hasPathTo(int v) {
        // If we have traveled vertex through dfs, then there is a path
        return marked[v];
    }

    public Iterable<Integer> pathTo(int v) {
        // No path
        if (!hasPathTo(v)) return null;
        for (int x = v; x != s; s = edgeTo[x]) {
            path.add(x);
        }
        path.add(s);
        Collections.reverse(path);
        return path;
    }
}
```

## Different Graph Implementations
- **Adjacency Matrix**
    - We keep a 2-Dimensional array where each index (v, w) represents the presence or the absense of an edge between vertices v and w.
        - Very fast constant time look up but $O(N^2)$ space complexity 
- **Edge Sets:**
    - We have a collection of all edges.
    - HashSet<Edge>, where each Edge is a pair of ints.
- **Adjacency lists:**
    - Maintain an array of lists index by vertex number.
    - This is efficient when graphs are "sparse"
- Whichever graph implementation we choose has implications on our runtime.

# Breadth First Search Implementation
- Unlike Depth First search, we propagate our search through different levels of the graph relative to some fringe node.
- For each vertex, we keep track of:
    - `marked`: If the vertex has been marked.
    - `edgeTo`: What vertex is the vertex connected to in our BFS propagation.
    - `distTo`: The total distance of our vertex to our fringe vertex.
- Since we go one layer at a time, we guarantee that the paths we find are the fasts paths.
- Breadth first search is $O(V+E)$
