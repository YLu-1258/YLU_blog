# Tree Rotation
- We may reotate trees left or right to keep trees balanced. In fact, in any BST, it is possible to move to a different configuration using "rotation".
- **rotateLeft(G):** let x be the right child of G. Make G the new left child of x.
    - X's left child now becomes G's right child.
- **rotateRight(G):** let x be the left child of G. Make G the new right child of x.
    - X's right child now becomes G's left child.

- These rotations can help us balance a tree.
    - The rotation preseves the search tree property.
    - We want to eventually reach a tree with the minimum average depth.
- The 2-3 tree can be used to model the rotations to self balance a binary search tree.
- There are many types of search trees:
    - Binary search Trees: Balanced by rotation but no existing algorithm for doing so yet.
    - 2-3 Trees: Balanced by construction: No rotation required.
    - We want to build a BST that is structurally identical to a 2-3 Tree

# Writing a BST that is identical to a 2-3 Tree
- Such a BST is called a Red-Black Tree.
    - We color some of the link red. In a 2-3 Tree, we seperate a two node into a larger node whose left child is the smaller node along with all the children that are smaller than the larger node.
    - The nodes within a 3 node are connected with a left-leaning left edge from the greater node as the parent, and the lesser node as the left child.
- A BST with left glue links that represents that represents a 2-3 tree is called a "left Leaning Red Black Binary Search Tree

- Searching in an LLRB for a key is exactly the same as a BST.

# LLRB Construction
- We don't want to build a 2-3 tree and convert it.
- We want to implement an LLRB insert
    - Insert as usual into a BST, but then use zero or more totations to maintain a 1-1 mapping with the 2-3 Tree
    - Pretend like we are a 2-3 tree when we are doing rotations.
- Should we use a red or black link when inserting?
    - In 2-3 trees, new values are always added to a leaf node.
    - **Insertion on the left:** We add a red link to connect the new node as the left child of a leaf node.
    - **Insertion on the right:** We add the right child, and we realize that we have a 3 node in a 2-3 tree. Thus, we want to rotate the parent to the left so that we form a left-leaning, red edge.
    - **Double Insertion on the left:** This means that we have a 
    - **Temporary 4 node violation**
