  title: Tools and Software Development Processes
  description: Students should have experience in blogging, coding with Jupyter Notebooks, and GitHub Pages; understnding of Linux, Python, Markdown, HTML, and JavaScript is expected. Students have previously established foundation using essential tools and software development processes. Weeks 0-3 will provide a quick review and students will start their Java coding journey.

  title: Java Mini-labs
  description: Students should have understanding of Fundamentals of Programming from Python, JavaScript, or other background. In this Sprint students will become familiar with Java types, booleans, iteration, recursion, using and writing objects through Mini-labs. These labs will introduce AP required aspects of Java, FRQ requirements, and review College Boards 10 Sprints online.

  title: Individual/Team Projects, N@tM
  description: In this Sprint students will continue to become familiar with Java development as they learn Web Development using the Spring Framework. Coding will focus on Restful APIs... receiving requests, working with data, and responding to requests. This will teach key Java concept while using Java Spring framework elements such as a Rest Controller, Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs), Object Relational Model (ORM) and Java Persistent API (JPA).

  title: College Board Teaching and Study
  description: This period students will perform formal teaching and grading on a College Board or College Articulated topic. There will be opportunities for lessons on fundamentals, extended learning on data structures, and/or FRQs. Student teams will have Jupyter notebooks, give tech talks, and and provide Hacks for homework. Teams need to make sure they review College Board materials and think about ways to help classmates succeed on test. Consider balance of lecture, hands-on practice, and lecture during teaching time. A teaching plan is required and must be reviewed by teacher prior to beginning work.
