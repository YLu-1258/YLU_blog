    "- The disjoint set data structure is used to solve the \"Dynamic Connectivity\" problem\n",
    "- The problem that we are working with is that we have various items. With a disjoint set, we can do the following:\n",
    "    - `connect(x, y)`: Connects item x and y\n",
    "    - `isConnected(x,y)`: Returns true if x and y are connected). Connections can be transitive, they do not need to share a direct connection, but they have have a path from one item to another.\n",

    "## The Naive Approach\n",
    "- Connecting two things: Record every connection in some data structure.\n",
    "- Checking connectedness: Do iteration over the lines to see if one item can be reached from the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Better Approach\n",
    "- We focus on connected components.\n",
    "- We just record the sets that each item belongs to\n",
    "    - We just care if items are connected, not how they are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Idea 1\n",
    "- We use a `List<Set<Integer>>`\n",
    "- Intuitive but terrible because this is complicated and slow. We would have to iterate through all the sets to find anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Idea 2\n",
    "- We store a list of integers where the ith entry gives a set number (\"id\") of item i.\n",
    "    - `connect(p, q)`: Change entires that equal `id[p]` to `id[q]`\n",
    "- This is still too slow, as connecting two items takes O(N) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Idea :3\n",
    "- We need to be able to change our set representation so that combining two sets into their union only requires changing one value.\n",
    "- We assign each item a parent rather than an id. This creates a tree structure where we may follow connections until we reach a root. All elements in the same set will share the same root.\n",
    "- Thus, we just need to make sure that items in the same set share the same root.\n",
    "- Steps, ex: connect(5,2):\n",
    "    - we set root(5)'s value equal to root(2).\n",
    "- To check if two items are connected, we simply check if the root of one item is equal to the root of another item.\n",
    "- The issue with this is that we havea worst case tree height of N for N items.\n",
    "    - We can make this more efficient by choosing how to connect two items.\n",
    "    - In fact, we put the item with the smaller height under the root of the item with the bigger height.\n",
    "    - However, tracking with height is tedious, instead we track with the number of elements in a tree, the \"weight\" of the tree.\n",
    "- Connecting based on height versus weight have different asymptotic efficiency.\n",
    "- To store the weight of the tree, we simply initialize another array that keeps track of the size of the tree that the item belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weighted Quick Union Performance.\n",
    "- The only way that we may create a tree of height 2 is if we connect a tree of height 1 with another tree of height 1. Each tree of height 1 has at least 2 items. Thus, the smallest tree of height 2 has 4 items. The smallest tree of height 3 will have 8 items, and so on.\n",
    "- The height of our tree scales with the log of the input size N.\n",
    "- Using height minimizes the worst case depth of a node using weight minimizes the average depth of a nodex`"
