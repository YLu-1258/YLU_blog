    "# BST Tree Height\n",
    "- Trees range from a best case of being \"bushy\" to worst-case being \"spindly\".\n",
    "    - Bushy trees minimize the height to around log(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree.\n",
    "    - Spindly trees maximize the height to around N where N is the number of nodes in the tree.\n",
    "- Bushy trees have height belonging to $\\Theta(\\log N)$ while spindly trees have $\\Theta(N)$\n",
    "    - A spindly tree is close to a linked list.\n",
    "- Big O is often used as a short hand for \"worst case\", but really, people mean the worst case runtime is $\\Theta(something)$\n",
    "    - Ex: BST heights are O(N^2) but aren't necessarily quadratic in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "# BST properties\n",
    "- The height and average depth are important properties of BSTs are important,\n",
    "    - The **depth** of a node is how far it is from the root\n",
    "    - The **height** of a tree is the depth of the deppest node.\n",
    "    - The **average depth** of a tree is the average depth of its nodes.\n",
    "- The **height** of a tree represents the worst case runtime to find a node\n",
    "- The **average depth** of a tree represents the average case runtie to find a node.\n",
    "- We reach the worst case height of **N** when we add sequentially larger elements.\n",
    "    - However, this is not likely to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Random Inserts: Random trees made from random inserts have $\\Theta(\\log N)$ average depth and height. Random trees are bushy and not spindly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, we can't always insert our items in a random order.\n",
    "    - Data comes in over time, so we don't have all of them at once.\n",
    "    - Time stamps are stored in increasing order as they come in. This would result in a height $N$ tree!\n",
    "    - We cannot rely on random input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoiding Imbalance.\n",
    "- The main problem with the worst case situation is adding new leaves at the bottom.\n",
    "    - What if we never added new leaves at the bottom?\n",
    "    - We can overstuff the existing leaf nodes, by storing multiple values in a node.\n",
    "- A solution could be a limit on the number of items that each node can store. Call this limit L.\n",
    "    - If any node has more than L items, we give an item to the parent.\n",
    "    - We can arbitrarily select the left-middle.\n",
    "        - However this causes a problem. We move the left middle up, but we can end up with a value smaller than the left middle in a node to the right of the left middle.\n",
    "        ![Overstuffed Tree](../assets/img/CS61B/overstuffed_tree.png)\n",
    "        - We may just split the node into two nodes. in the example above, 16 would just become its own node.\n",
    "        ![Split Node](../assets/img/CS61B/split_node.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chain Reaction Spltting\n",
    "- Once a parent node gets too full, we split it and form another tree.\n",
    "- The left half children goes to the left subtree, and the right half children goes to th eright subtree.\n",
    "- If a root node gets too full, we take the left middle element and make that the new root node, with the split tree as its children.\n",
    "- In both cases, we maintain that all nodes in the left sub-tree is smaller than the parent, and all nodes in the right sub-tree is greater tha nthe parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Balance\n",
    "- Splitting (B-Trees) trees have perfect balance,\n",
    "- If we split the root, every node gets pushed down by one level.\n",
    "- If a leaf node is split, the height doesn't change.\n",
    "- All operations are guaranteed to have $O(\\log N)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uses\n",
    "- B-Tree with small L are used as a simple balanced search tree.\n",
    "- B-Tree with large L represents databases and filesystems with very large records.\n",
    "- No matter the insertion order a B-Tree is always bushy.\n",
    "- B-Trees have two nice invariants\n",
    "    - All leaves must be the same distance from the root\n",
    "    - A non-leaf node with k items must have exactly k+1 children.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B-Tree runtime for `contains`\n",
    "- The worst case number of nodes to inspect is **H+1**\n",
    "- The worst case number of items to inspect per node is **L**\n",
    "- The overall runtime is $O(HL)$\n",
    "    - H = $\\Theta(\\log N)$\n",
    "    - runtime is $O(L \\log N)$"
