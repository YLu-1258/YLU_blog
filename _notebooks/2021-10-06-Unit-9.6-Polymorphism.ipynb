    "## What is Polymorphism?\n",
    "**Polymorphism** is a greek word meaning many-formed (poly=many, morph=form). In the context of programming, Polymorphic behavior is defined as being able to reference objects of different types at different points during compilation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One example of Java polymorphism, is our ability to store references to objects instantiated from any class AND its *subclasses* in a variable. Another example is for methods, where we override the behavior of a method in a subclass such that it differs from the parent class. We successfully perform polymorphism when we override non-static methods and execute them from the correct, corresponding class at runtime.  \n",

When we instantiate a dynamic variable that is of *a different type* from our static variable, our program at run time will attempt to search for the methods and attributes in the superclass, NOT the child class that we created.
