    "# Technique 1\n",
    "- We may directly measure the execution time in seconds of a program using some experimental method.\n",
    "    - Use a physical stopwatch.\n",
    "    - Use Unix `time` command.\n",
    "    - Use the Princeton standard library which has a `stopwatch` class.\n",
    "- Cons of this approach:\n",
    "    - The analysis would take as long as the program execution. Could take a long time.\n",
    "    - Runtimes vary on different machines, compilers, data, so we would get a different time every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Technique 2A\n",
    "- We may count the total number of operations completed by each algorithms instead. This is machine independent.\n",
    "- However, this is still tedious to compute because there are a lot of operations we need to keep track of. With an arbitrary input size, we do not know the actual runtime of our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Technique 2B\n",
    "- For this to work with data with arbitrary lengths, we can calculate the counts in terms of the input size `N`.\n",
    "- This is called **Symbolic Counting**. This enables us to see how the algorithm scales with input size. \n",
    "- If we calculate the symbolic counting of each operation in the fast approach vs the naive approach, we see that the fast approach performs much better than the slow approach in the worst case scenario.\n",
    "- Some operations in the naive approach scales quadratically $N^2$, while the worst case scaling in the fast approach scales linearly $N$.\n",
    "    - We observe that parabolas ($N^2$) always grow faster than lines ($N$).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Asymptotic Behavior\n",
    "- In runtime analysis, we are concerned about what happens for large values of $N$. Scalable algorithms have better asymptotic runtimes than those that scale poorly.\n",
    "- Thus, we want to characterize the runtimes of our programs with a simple yet rigorous manner. Technique 2B demonstrates the superiority of an algorithm, but it is not simple nor mathematically rigourous.\n",
    "    - We apply simplifications to solve these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplification 1: Consider Only the Worst Case.\n",
    "- We only care about the worst case when we compare algorithms.\n",
    "- We take the symbolic counts of various operations and observe the worst case count, or the fastest rate of growth operation and use that as our measure:\n",
