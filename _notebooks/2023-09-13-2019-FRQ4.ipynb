    "1. Allocate a `numRows` by `numCols` 2D array to store lights\n",
    "2. Properly iterate over each indice in the array\n",
    "3. Introduce randomness to give each light a 40% probabilty of being on, We can use the random library here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the `lightsprivate` 2D array of booleans, I will create another private `Random` object to serve as our RNG. In the constructor, we should first instantiate the array with the appropriate size. We do so using the following line:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`private boolean[][] lightsprivate;`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, I will use a nested for loop to iterate through each individual index in each row of the grid. In this process, I will initialize the value by generating a random from 0-9 with the line `RNG.nextInt(10) >= 6`, with four values (6,7,8,9) reserved for turning the lights on. To test the algorithm, I have written a public `printLights` method to print the values of each light in the grid.\n",

At the end, we return the value of the cell if no other conditionals pass as our default return value."

    "Some future directions I could go with this project is maybe incorporate a hardware aspect to it. I have a raspberry pi at home, so it wouldn't be impossible to hook it up to a 16bit LED display and display more complex shapes. Instead of randomly assigning values to certain elements, instead I could send certain images to the raspbery pi, have a program downsize it and render the lower-resolution version on the display. The general intuition would be the same, I would just need to incorporate more options for a light other than on or off, such as color or animation patterns."
