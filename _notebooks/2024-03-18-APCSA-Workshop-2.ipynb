    "    - private instances \n",
    "    - declare headers for class methods\n",
    "    - properly uses methods from given class\n",
    "    - methods returns the right thing based on logic\n",
    "2. Use meaningful variable names\n",

    "4. Check your code with the examples provided\n",
    "5. Super() must be in the first line of your constructor\n",
    "6. Initialize your variables outside of the constructor and any method (to have the correct scope)\n",
