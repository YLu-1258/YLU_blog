    "# Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "- OOP provides a method for organizing large programs\n",
    "    - large programs can be organized into small, modular components that can be developed at ones.\n",
    "    - Extends data abstraction, but also combines information and behavior.\n",
    "    - Objects represent their real-life counterparts (or they can be an abstract idea!)\n",
    "- This allows our code to not just be a long list of instructions, but rather the combined interactions of many small objects and components.\n",
    "    - Each object has its own local state, which may change over time.\n",
    "    - Mutation happens at a local state, not at a global level.\n",
    "        - Mutations only occur to a certain object, and each object should know how to manage its local state.\n",
    "    - Interactions with an object occur through the **methods**.\n",
    "    - Objects are all instances of a common **class**.\n",
    "        - The class provides a blueprint for constructing the objects.\n",
    "    - Different classes relate to each other\n",
    "- Specialized language and vocab:\n",
    "    - **Class**: Defines how objects of a type behave.\n",
    "    - **Object**: An instance of a class, with it's type the class.\n",
    "    - **Method**: A function called on an object using dot expression (`<object>.<method>()`)\n",
    "        - Functions are typically defined within the global frame, but a method is **specific to a particular object**.\n",
    "- Ex: Python lists are an example of a class"
