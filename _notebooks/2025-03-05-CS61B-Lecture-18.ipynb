    "- We may reotate trees left or right to keep trees balanced. In fact, in any BST, it is possible to move to a different configuration using \"rotation\".\n",
    "- **rotateLeft(G):** let x be the right child of G. Make G the new left child of x.\n",
    "    - X's left child now becomes G's right child.\n",
    "- **rotateRight(G):** let x be the left child of G. Make G the new right child of x.\n",

    "- These rotations can help us balance a tree.\n",
    "    - The rotation preseves the search tree property.\n",
    "    - We want to eventually reach a tree with the minimum average depth.\n",
    "- The 2-3 tree can be used to model the rotations to self balance a binary search tree.\n",
    "- There are many types of search trees:\n",
    "    - Binary search Trees: Balanced by rotation but no existing algorithm for doing so yet.\n",
    "    - 2-3 Trees: Balanced by construction: No rotation required.\n",

    "# Writing a BST that is identical to a 2-3 Tree\n",
    "- Such a BST is called a Red-Black Tree.\n",
    "    - We color some of the link red. In a 2-3 Tree, we seperate a two node into a larger node whose left child is the smaller node along with all the children that are smaller than the larger node.\n",
    "    - The nodes within a 3 node are connected with a left-leaning left edge from the greater node as the parent, and the lesser node as the left child.\n",
    "- A BST with left glue links that represents that represents a 2-3 tree is called a \"left Leaning Red Black Binary Search Tree\n",

    "    - Insert as usual into a BST, but then use zero or more totations to maintain a 1-1 mapping with the 2-3 Tree\n",
    "    - Pretend like we are a 2-3 tree when we are doing rotations.\n",
    "- Should we use a red or black link when inserting?\n",
    "    - In 2-3 trees, new values are always added to a leaf node.\n",
    "    - **Insertion on the left:** We add a red link to connect the new node as the left child of a leaf node.\n",
    "    - **Insertion on the right:** We add the right child, and we realize that we have a 3 node in a 2-3 tree. Thus, we want to rotate the parent to the left so that we form a left-leaning, red edge.\n",
