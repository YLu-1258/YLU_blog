    "## Bits\n",
    "- Computers stores information in memory as sequence of ones and zeros.\n",
    "- When variables are declared in Java, the computer sets aside exactly enough bits to hold an object/thing of that type.\n",
    "    - Declaring an int sets a box of 32 bits.\n",
    "    - Declaring a double sets aside a box of 64 bits.\n",
    "- **Golden Rule of Equals (GRoE):** In Java, the equals sign copies the bits from one variable to another variable.\n",
    "- Everything in Java that is not a primitive is called a reference type.\n",
    "- When an object of a reference type is instantiated:\n",
    "    - Java initializes memory for each instance variable of the class.\n",
    "    - Java then stores the address to the object as an integer to the variable. The `new` keyword finds a place in memory to allocate the object to, and then returns the address of the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameter Passing\n",
    "- Passing parameters to a function also follows the golden rule of equals.\n",
    "    - Bits are copied over into new variables defined in the function signature.\n",
    "    - Java is a purely pass by value language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison\n",
    "- The `==` operator compares the bits in the two memory boxes.\n",
    "- To compare the content of two arrays, use `Arrays.equals`"
