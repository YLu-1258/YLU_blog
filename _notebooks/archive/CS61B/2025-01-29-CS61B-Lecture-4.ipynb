    "- Although the IntList is a functional list, we can improve it by hiding some of the abstraction object.\n",
    "    - We will make it so that someone with no recursion would know how to make it. We want to hide away the recursive structure.\n",
    "    - In other words, `SLList` will add an abstraction barrier that will handle all the base logic for manipulating the list, without the enduser knowing how the list works. This simplifies thinking about the list as an object. \n",

    "    - We can prevent this by making attributes that we want to hide (such as first) `private`.\n",
    "    - This enforces an abstraction barrier in Java.\n",

    "    - Private hides implementation details from class users. It also means there is less for users to understand, and also makes it safer for us to change private methods.\n",
    "- We may also nest classes within each other, and make the entirety of the IntNode class a private class. This adds futher baby proofing.  \n",
    "    - we may also use the static keyword for the `IntNode` class to protect it from accessing any instance attributes of `SLList`.\n",
    "    - The static keyword then saves a little overhead memory, as now IntNode does not need to contain a reference to any other `SLList` instance.\n",

    "    - This comes at smaller costs though, we allocate more memory to store the size, and also slightly more time to perform other operations as we manipulate size itself.\n",
    "- We can do this because SSList acts as a middle man for the user to interact with the list made of IntNodes. So this middle man can store metadata for us such as size.\n",
