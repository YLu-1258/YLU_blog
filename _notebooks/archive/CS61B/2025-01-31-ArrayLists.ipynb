    "# Linked List Performance\n",
    "- While the Linked List is performant in operations such as insertion, addition, and removal of nodes, it is much more inefficient at retrieving data.\n",
    "    - inthis is because we only have pointers to the front and the back of a list for a DLList, which means in the worst case situation, if our index of interest was in the very middle, we would have to traverse `size/2` number of nodes before we arrive at what we are interested in.\n",
    "- On the other hand, we know that arrays are much more performant at accessing data membeters, as array attributes are accessible by numerical means. This provides constant time for element access in an array.\n",
