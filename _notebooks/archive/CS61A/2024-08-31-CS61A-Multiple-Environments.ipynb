    "- Remember, the earlier the frame is, the more towards the bottom it is in the environmental diagram.\n",
    "- For nested functions, we first evaluate whatever the operands of the function is.\n",
    "    - We first draw a new frame for the operand function.\n",
    "    - We then pass the return value of the operand function to the operator function.\n",
    "- **<mark>Environment == Sequence of frames</mark>**\n",
    "    - Only a global frame\n",
    "    - local frame followed by a global frame.\n",
    "    - we can find any given environment by following the parents of the frames.\n",
    "- **Names have no meaning without an environment.**\n",
    "    - Every expression is evaluated in the context of an environment.\n",
    "        - This means that any name is evaluated to the value which is bound to that name in the earliest frame of the current environment containing the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Names can have different meanings in different Environments\n",
    "- This is because different environments have different combinations of frames.\n",
    "    - Within each frame, there is a possibility of a particular name being defined to another value.\n",
    "- It is important to note that a call expression and the actual function body are evaluated in seperate environments.\n",
    "    - The call expression belongs to a parent frame (a \"later\" environment)\n",
    "    - The function body creates another frame (an \"earlier\" environment)\n",
    "    - Because of this, we have have functions that have the same name as their parameters.\n"
