    "# Interpreting Scheme\n",
    "- There are two parts to an interpreter\n",
    "    - **Eval:** The eval evaluates primitive and combined expressions. It calls apply to apply a procedure to certain arguments in expressions.\n",
    "    - **Apply:**: Applys a specific procedure onto the provided arguments to retrieve a result.\n",
    "- Both of these parts are mutually recursive, while eval is also recursive to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Eval Function\n",
    "- The base case of the eval function are primitive values (numbers), or values that are bound to symbols.\n",
    "- The recursive calls must evaluate the operators and the operands themselves.\n",
    "    - Eval is recursively called on all of the arguments until they are reduced down to a primitive. Special forms may also be arguments, and they are also evaluated.\n",
    "    - The apply function is then called with the operator and the reduced arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Apply Function\n",
    "- The base case are built-in primitive procedures\n",
    "- The recursive calls of Apply on a user-defined procedure will repeatedly call eval on the body of the user-defined procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environments\n",
    "- Eval must be given an environment so that it could properly look up names bound to symbols in that environment.\n",
    "- The environments that are used by Eval are created when Apply is ran on a user-defined feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Special Forms\n",
    "- The scheme_eval function dispatches on expression forms, different actions are performed on different expressions:\n",
    "    - Symbols are bound to values in the current environment.\n",
    "    - Self-evaluating expressions are returned.\n",
    "    - All other legal expressions in scheme are represented as Scheme lists, called combinations.\n",
    "- Special forms are identified by the first list element. All other expressions that are not special forms are just call expressions."
