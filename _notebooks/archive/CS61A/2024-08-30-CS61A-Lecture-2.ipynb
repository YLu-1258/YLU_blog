    "2. Find function's formal parameters to the arguments in that grame\n",
    "3. Edecute the body of the function within the new environment\n",

    "- The code of the function itself is not called until the function itself is called with an argument.\n",
    "- For this class, we only open new frames for the user-defined function.\n",

    "## Looking Up Names in Environments\n",
    "- Every expression is evalated in the context of an environment.\n",
    "- When we refer to a frame as being \"early\" it is the one at the bottom of our environmental diagram.\n",
    "- The global frame is always the last frame that we look at.\n",
    "- An environment always comprises of the frame in which another screen is being executed.\n",
