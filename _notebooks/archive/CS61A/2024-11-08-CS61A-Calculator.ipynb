    "# Programming Languages\n",
    "- An interpreter is a program that takes code written in the programming language as input and executes the code to create the behavior of the program.\n",
    "- Scheme is powerful but has few rules. Can be easily implemented in Python.\n",
    "- Programs may be thought of as trees of expressions. Interpreters work through tree recursion.\n",
    "- Computers execute programs written in various programming languages\n",
    "    - **Machine Languages:** statements are interpreted by the hardware itself\n",
    "        - A fixed set of instructions invoke operations implemented by the CPU.\n",
    "        - Has limited access to its own memory, but has ways to access additional memory in caches, main memory, and computer disks.\n",
    "        - Cannot change the programming language itself without changing the computer circuitry.\n",
    "        - Harder to program in beacuse operations refer to specific hardware memory addresses and there are no abstraction mechanisms.\n",
    "    - **High-level languages:** statements and expressions are interpreted by another program or compiled into another language.\n",
    "        - Interpreting: reading the program and executing behavior\n",
    "        - Compiling: Translating the language to machine language.\n",
    "        - Provides means of abstraction such as naming, function definition, and objects.\n",
    "        - Abstracts away system details to be independent of hardware and operating system.\n",
    "            - THe same program can run on different operating systems or hardware.\n",
    "- Modern languages mix compilation and interpretation. Statements are compiled just in time as if they were interpreted.\n",
    "- High-level languages are built on other high level languages\n",
    "    - Machine language is used to build the compiler for the C language (a higher level language) which is then used to create an interpreter for python.\n",
    "- Python is compiled into python 3 byte code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metalinguistic Abstraction\n",
    "- Another type of abstration is to define a new language that is tailored to a particular type of application or problem domain.\n",
    "    - Ex: Erlang was created for concurrent programs. It has built-in elements for expressing concurrent communication, and is used in cases such as chat servers with many simultaneous connections.\n",
    "    - Ex: MediaWiki mark-up language was designed for generating static web pages. It has built-in elements for text formatting and cross-page linking. Used for blogging.\n",
    "- A programming language has:\n",
    "    - **Syntax:** THe legal statements and expressions in the language.\n",
    "    - **Semantics:** The execution/evaluation rule for those statements and expressions.\n",
    "- A new programming language requires:\n",
    "    - **Specification:** A document taht describes the precise syntax and semantics of the language.\n",
    "    - **Canonical Implementation:** An interpreter or compiler for the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Parsing\n",
    "- To implemented a programming language, we must first parse the program text into a structure easy for interpretation\n",
    "    - Scheme is a tree-based language.\n",
    "    - Parsing converts scheme text into an expression tree so the program may be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading Scheme Lists\n",
    "- We must read scheme lists and convert them into an interpretable structure.\n",
    "- A scheme list is written as elements in  parenthesis, but each element can be a combination of other statements, or a primative expression.\n",
    "- We must parse this string representation into a scheme representation.\n",
    "    - In scheme, expressions are represented as Pairs (linked list)\n",
    "- Parsing has two parts\n",
    "    - A parser takes text and returns an expression.\n",
    "    - Texts are converted into tokens using **Lexical analysis** which are then converted into an expression using **Syntactic analysis**.\n",
    "    - Tokens are symbols representing atomic units of the programming language. \n",
    "    - Syntatic analysis is a tree-recursive processes that balances parenthesis and also returns a tree structure containing the tokens.\n",
    "- Syntatic analysis identifies the hierarchical struct ure of an expression, which may be nested.\n",
    "    - The base case are atomic symbols and numbers\n",
    "    - Recursive calls are `scheme_read` calls on sub-expressions and combining them.\n",
    "    - The `scheme_read` function only ends when the ending parenthesis is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation\n",
    "- The Eval function evaluates an expression in the language represented as a scheme_list.\n",
    "    - It computes the value of an expression\n",
    "    - It is a generic function that dispatches on the type of the expression (primitive or call).\n",
    "- For a calculator program:\n",
    "    - A number evaluates to itself\n",
    "    - A scheme list applies the rest of the scheme list (evaluated arguments) to the operator (first argument)\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Interpreters\n",
    "- Interpreters have a Read-Eval-print Loop\n",
    "    - Print a prompt\n",
    "    - Read text input from the user.\n",
    "    - Parse the text input into an expression.\n",
    "    - Evaluate the expression.\n",
    "    - If any errors occur, report those errors, otherwise, print the value of the expression and repeat.\n",
    "- Exceptions are raised within lexical analysis to ensure that the code is well formed.\n",
    "- An interpreter should not halt on an error, but rather provide information about the error.\n",
    "- Parsing and evaluation are both placed in a try statement that catches any errors.\n"
