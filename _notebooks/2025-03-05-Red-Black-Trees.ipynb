    "  - rotateRight(G): Let x be the left child of G, make G the right child of x.\n",

    "  - We store left child of x as y. We know y is greater than G by BST invariants.\n",

    "- Rotations shorten or lengthen a tree's height but always preserves the tree's property.\n",
    "\n",

    "- We combine the simplicity of a BST with the balanced nature of a 2-3 Tree.\n",
    "- A 2-3 Tree with only nodes with 2 children is already a BST.\n",
    "- We focus on the 3-children case. One option is to create a glue node that does not hold any information but only shows that the two children are part of one node.\n",
    "  - This would simulate a 2-3 Tree structure.\n",
    "- However, creating dummy nodes would result in much wasted space. Thus, we can also just color the edges to glue together elements of the same node.\n",
    "- For a left-leaning red black tree, we make the left element of a 2-node a left child of the right element.\n",
