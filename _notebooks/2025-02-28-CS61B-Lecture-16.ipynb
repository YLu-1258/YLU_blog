    "- An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is defined only by operations, not by its implementation.\n",
    "## TreeSet and TreeMap\n",
    "- A traditional linked list structure is too slow to check if an element exists within the set.\n",
    "    - We have to traverse through all the elements of the Linked list to find the element.\n",
    "    - It is a slow search even if the list was in order.\n",
    "- To add efficiency, we are going to use a binary search tree to represent a set.\n",
    "- A tree contains a set of nodes and edges that connect its nodes.\n",
    "    - There is exactly one path between any two nodes\n",
    "- A **Rooted Tree** has one node called the root.\n",
    "    - Every node except for the root has exactly one parent.\n",
    "    - A node with no child is called a leaf.\n",
    "- In a rooted binary tree, every node has either 0, 1, or 2 children (subtrees).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Search Trees\n",
    "- A Binary Search Tree is a tree that satisfies the BST Property. \n",
    "    - For every node X in the tree:\n",
    "        - Every key in the left subtree is less than X's key.\n",
    "        - Every key in the right subtree is greater than X's key.\n",
    "- The ordering in a BST must be complete, transitive, and antisymmetric. Given keys p and q:\n",
    "    - Exactly one of $p < q$ and $q > p$ are true.\n",
    "    - $p < q$ and $q < r$ imples $p < r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching BST \n",
    "- If searchKey equals T.key, we return T.key.\n",
    "    - If searchkey < T.key, we search T.left\n",
    "    - If searchkey > T.key, we search T.right\n",
    "- Bushy BSTs are extrememly fast for searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inserting BST\n",
    "- We search for the key\n",
    "    - If the key is found, no nothing,\n",
    "    - If the key is not found, we create a new node and set an appropriate link.\n",

    "## Deleting BST\n",
    "- Three cases:\n",
    "- If we delete a node with 0 children, we may just simply remove it.\n",
    "- If we delete a node with 1 children, we may just set the parent of the child of the removed node to the parent of the removed node.\n",
    "- If we delete a node with 2 children, we use hibbard deletion.\n",
    "    - We want a new node to replace the deleted node. This node muts be greater than all nodes in the left subtree, and less than all nodes in the right subtree.\n",
