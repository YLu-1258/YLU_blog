    "For this question, I had incorrectly thought that the program wouldn't compile because I didn't understand the substring method. I thought that the substring method's end index marked the last character that it would return from the string, but really, the last character grabbed by substring is `end_indice-1`, which would be within the bounds of the string. The correct answer should've been C."
