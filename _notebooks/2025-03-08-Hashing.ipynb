    "- The motivation behind hashing is that insertion, removal, and contain checks all occur in $O(1)$ time in the best case.\n",
    "- This offers efficiency bonuses greater than that of the tree-based map as the tree structure requires us to have elements that can be compared to each other.\n",
    "- The principle of the idea behind Hashing is that it allows us to create data-based indices for an array structure.\n",

    "- Design:\n",
    "    - Create a boolean type `ArrayList` that has size 2 billion.\n",
    "    - The `add(int x)` method sets the `x` position in the arraylist to true in $\\Theta(1)$ time.\n",
    "    - The `contains(int x)` checks if the value in the `x` position in the array list is true in $\\Theta(1)$ time as well."

    "- We want to be able to generate a number for any string.\n",
    "    - One idea is to use the first letter of the string, but this may result in a **collision** if two strings have the same starting letter. In that case, the two strings would have the same hashcode.\n",
    "    - To avoid collisions, we may represent strings in base 26, where each letter is assigned a number from 1 to 26. This way, we may represent any character in base 26 and have a unique integer representation for any string.\n",

    "## Valid Hashcode\n",
    "- There are 2 properties for a valid hashcode:\n",
    "    - ***Deterministic**: The `hashCode()` function of two equal object must be equal to each other.\n",
    "    - ***Consistent:*** The `hashCode()` function returns the same integer every time for the same instance of an object.\n",
    "        - `hashCode()` must be independent of time-varying attributes, RNG, and any other source of inconsistency.\n",
    "- The hashcode does not have to be unique for two objects.\n",

    "## Good Hashcodes\n",
    "- A good hashcode as 3 properties.\n",
    "    - The `hashCode()` function must be valid.\n",
    "    - The `hashCode()` function values hsould be spread as uniformly as possible over the set of all integers\n",

    "# Handling COllisions:\n",
    "- Collisions occur in hashing when multiple leements have the same index.\n",
    "- Two common methods to deal with collision:\n",
    "    - **Linear Probing:** Store the colliding key somewhere else in the array, maybe with the next open array space. This is implemented in distributed hash tables.\n",
    "    - **External Chaining:** We may store all keys with the same hash value in a collection of their own. This is commonly done with a `LinkedList` implementation. When we make a collection of entires sharing a single index, that collection is called a **bucket**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Resizing and Hash Table Performance\n",
    "- As we add more and more elements, the hash table should expand it's underlying array to free up more possible indicies to maintain efficiency and lessen collisions.\n",
    "- The load factor is a ratio that describes how full a hash table is.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{load factor} = \\frac{\\text{size()}}{\\text{array.length}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- Once the hashtable exceeds the maximum load factor, then the hash table should resize.\n",
    "    - Typically done geometrically by a factor of 2.\n",
    "    - Resizing does not appear if we add a key-value pair that already exists in the hashmap.\n",
    "- Since the index is calculated under the modulous of the array length, after resizing has been done, all items would need to be relocated."
