    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!  \n",

    "a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO  \n",

    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above  \n",
    "* Say I was creating a user authenticaion app. I have two attributes, a user biography, and a password hash. The password hash would mostly have a private access modifier as I would not want external code to be abl to access sensitive information. The user biography would likely be accessed by most applications on the frontend interface, so I might opt to keep it public. However, realistically, I would probably keep everything private and use setters and getters when necessary. The getters and setters then, would most likely be public so that outside classes can perform necessary actions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects  \n"

We can create a parent class called `Transport`, which contains critical information like the Identitifaction of the vehicle, the deadline to deliver by, and the name of the driver. Subsequently, we can create different child classes to be used, like `Truck`, `Ship`, or `Plane`, each with their own additional unique attributes like fuel level, max speed in nautical miles, and altitude in meters, etc. This would reduce code redundancy because it ensures that the most important attributes are inherited across all objects.\n",
