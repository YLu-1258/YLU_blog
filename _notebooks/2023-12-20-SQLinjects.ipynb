    "## What is a SQL Inject\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, web services provide users the choice to input data, which is then sent to the backend of the service. This data could then be processed and be stored in a database table for future use. A SQL Inject takes advantage of this relationship. Since every database interaction can be represented with an SQL query, if our input data happened to be a SQL fragment that completed the query to perform unexpected tasks, then isn't it possible for us to gain unauthorized access to the database? \n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the notable SQL Inject breaches in the past years:\n",
    " - GhostShell attack (Targetted university records)\n",
    " - Turkish government (Breached government website to wipe national debt)\n",
    " - 7-Eleven breach (Stole credit card information from corporate systems)\n",

    "## What does an SQL Inject look like?\n",
    "Pretend our school had a website has a simple function that returns a users information when they input their unique id and password (that only they know about). To retrieve this information, our backend has the following SQL query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users_info WHERE uuid = 1920450 AND password=\"5994471abb01112afcc18159f6cc74b4f511b9980\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On the frontend, we may expect an html table that lists the information of the user who corresponds to the id that we inputted. Maybe something that looks like this\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Performing the Inject\n",
    "Now, knowing the name of the table, we could do a lot more with this feature. Even if I wasn't a student who knew his ID for a look up, I could still perform an SQL inject on this service. What if instead of an ID, I entered the following string as my query?\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "1927347 OR 1=1; --\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users_info WHERE uuid = 1927347 OR 1=1; -- AND password=\"5994471abb01112afcc18159f6cc74b4f511b9980\";\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down each part of the string:\n",
    " - `1927347`: A random uuid that we supplied, THIS DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO EXIST. You'll see why.\n",
    " - `OR`: A boolean condition in SQL, essentially makes it so that only one of the conditions must be met for the command (`SELECT * FROM users_info`) to execute properly.\n",
    "   - Now do you see where we are going with this?\n",
    " - `1=1`: A simple arithmetic statement that is ***ALWAYS TRUE***\n",
    "   - Even if our id isn't correct because the fact 1=1 is true for *every record of the table*, our database now thinks we want to return **every single row**.\n",
    " - `; --`: The semicolon finishes up our sql query, and the -- comments out the rest of the SQL query, maintaining the integrity of our statement and allowing the injected query to run properly.  \n",

    "## Methods of SQL Injects\n",
    "There are many different ways of performing an SQL inject. Ultimately, it hinges on your knowledge of SQL syntax to game whatever query that your target has set up. Here are just some of the few strategies I've learned over the years, but you can gain addiitonal practice from doing CTF challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using keyword OR\n",
    "Essentially, this was the strategy that you saw above. The intuition behind this strategy is offering an alternate condition for a Given SQL statement to succeed, to bypass any authentication checks. Keep in mind that there might be additional query after the ineject, so we would require SQL comments like `--` to ensure our inject works properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Union \n",
    "The `UNION` keyword in SQL is often used to join two SQL statements together, more specifically, the `SELECT` statement. What this allows us to do is to get the results of two seperate SELECT statements, and can be used to give us additional info on the database's structure by writing a new command. Take the SQL statement from above:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users_info WHERE uuid = ... AND password='...';\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "The statement created by the server only looks for info in the `users_info` table. But with union, we can add an additional query to the end of this. For this example, I'll be performing an inject on the uuid field. The inject will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "123' UNION SELECT name, sql from sqlite_master;--\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the actual query looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM users_info WHERE uuid ='123' UNION SELECT name, sql from sqlite_master;-- ... AND password=';\n",
    "```  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the first select statement doesn't return anything, our union statement will select the name and schema of the database in the backend. However, this command only works for an sqlite server, as we know the name of the table to be sqlite_master, and probably won't work for any services hosted through MySQL, MariaDB, Postgresql or etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Placing Limits on User Inputs\n",
    "A common, and simple strategy to use is to place restrictions on what the user can input. Much of our SQLinjects rely on adding additional SQL statements and code to execute what we wish for it to do. Some of the following tactics could work to protect against SQL Injects:\n",
    " - Reducing the maximum input length\n",
    " - Restricting the use of special characters used for query (; - ' etc.) \n",
    " - Validating user input (try not to use textboxes if you can, utilize selection boxes, dropdown menus, etc.)\n",
    " - Principle of least privilege\n",
    "    - Do not give DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE permissions if not needed. Give the least authority on the databse that's required for the service to function.\n",
