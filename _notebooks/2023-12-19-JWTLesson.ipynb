    "JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are crucial for secure and efficient user authentication in web development. \n",
    "- They help manage user identity and sessions across different parts of a system. \n",
    "- They play a key role in stateless authentication, allowing servers to verify user identity without storing session data.\n",

    "\n",
    "- What is a web token?\n",
    "    - A web token is a piece of information that represents a user's identity or session and is used for authentication and authorization in web applications. It is typically a string of characters, often encoded in a JSON format, and is digitally signed to ensure its integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is the structure of a JSON Web Token: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Header\n",
    "    - The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the **token**, which is JWT, and the **algorithm** that is used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA SHA256. It is Base64Url encoded to form the first part of the JWT\n",
    "2. Payload\n",
    "    - Claims and user data\n",
    "    - claims are statements about the entity (users)\n",
    "    - There are three types of claims: \n",
    "        - registered: predefined claims that are no mandatory but recommended\n",
    "        - **public**: claims defined within the IA and JSON web token registry\n",
    "        - private: custom claims created to share information between parties that agree to using them\n",
    "3. Signature\n",
