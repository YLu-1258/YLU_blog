    "2. **Instance Variable**:\n",

    "5. **Other Methods**:\n",
    "    - `public String getBookInfo()`: This method returns a string containing information about the textbook\n",
    "    - It calls the `getBookInfo()` method of the superclass `Book` to get the title and price, and then appends the edition number to it.\n",
    "    - `public boolean canSubstituteFor(Textbook other)`: This method checks if the current textbook can substitute another textbook (`other`)\n",

    "## Hacks\n",
    "### Inheritance (Unit 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: You are developing a program to manage a zoo, where various types of animals are kept in different enclosures. To streamline your code, you decide to use inheritance to model the relationships between different types of animals and their behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Explain the concept of inheritance in Java. Provide an example scenario where inheritance is useful.\n",
    "* In Java, inheritance is the principle of creating subclasses that extends behaviors, methods, and attributes from a parent class. This particular feature is useful in many cases were we have to create objects that are similar to each other. An example is if you had a shipping comapny. We can create a parent class called `Transport`, which contains critical information like the Identitifaction of the vehicle, the deadline to deliver by, and the name of the driver. Subsequently, we can create different child classes to be used, like `Truck`, `Ship`, or `Plane`, each with their own additional unique attributes like fuel level, max speed in nautical miles, and altitude in meters, etc. This would reduce code redundancy because it ensures that the most important attributes are inherited across all objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement a Java class hierarchy to represent different types of animals in the zoo. Create a superclass `Animal` with basic attributes and methods common to all animals, and at least three subclasses representing specific types of animals with additional attributes and methods. Include comments to explain your code, specifically how inheritance is used."
