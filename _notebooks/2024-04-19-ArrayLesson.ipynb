    "# 6.1 - Intro to Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are used to store one type of data, whether it is a primitive or reference data type. Arrays themselves are reference types. They are best thought of as a list of items with a fixed size, as arrays have a set size that cannot be changed (don't confuse this with ArrayLists which can also be thought of as a list - we'll learn about ArrayLists in\n",
    "Unit 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are denoted by brackets {0}, with items separated by commas such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can use arrays, we need to have an import statement, which is\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.Arrays;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Making Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to make arrays: using a constructor and using a pre-initialized array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructor\n",
    "As with other reference types, we can initialize arrays using a constructor. However, the constructor is slightly different from the constructors from Unit 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[numberOfItems];\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "To create an array that holds 10 integers, we would do `int[] ourArray = new int[10];`\n",
    "The items in the array are initialized differently depending on the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integers are initialized to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "- Doubles are initialized to 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "- Booleans are initialized to false\n",
    "\n",
    "- All reference types are initialized to null\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk about filling constructed lists in the next topic when we discuss traversing arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-initialized Array\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also set an array to a pre-initialized array, similar to how we initialize strings. Here, we will initialize an array of 10 integers as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] ourArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "We access elements in arrays using bracket notation as follows: arrayName[index]. The most important thing to know is that Java is a zero-indexed language, so the first item has index 0, and not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about the index of the last item, we need to discuss how to find the array length. The array length is actually an instance variable specific to that particular array denoted as arrayName.length (not to be confused with length) for Strings). Note that this is not a method, so there are no parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the last item in the array can be accessed by using arrayName.length - 1. Do not confuse this with the constructor in which we use arrayName.length in brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use an index outside the allowed range, we will get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n",
    "Here is a question: how do we access the even numbers in arrayOne from above?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### answer\n",
    "```java\n",
    "2 = arrayOne[1]\n",
    "4 = arrayOne[3]\n",
    "6 = arrayOne[5]\n",
    "8 = arrayOne[7]\n",
    "10 = arrayOne[9]\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms to Remember and Review\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>Arrays</mark>: `Arrays` are a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. They have a fixed size and can be accessed using an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>array.length</mark>: The property \"length\" in an array refers to the number of elements it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</mark>: `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is an exception that occurs when trying to access an invalid index position in an array. It is thrown to indicate that the index used to access an array is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.\n",

    "# 6.2 - Traversing Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Traversing an array means to access every value in the array. This is typically done using a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forward Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "To traverse an array in order, you can use the following for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n",
    "  // access or modify array elements\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reverse Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "To traverse an array in reverse order, you can use the following for loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n",
    "  // access or modify array elements\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limited Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only want to traverse a portion of the array, you can specify a different start and end index. For example, to traverse from the second element to the end, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = 1; i < array.length - 1; i++) {\n",
    "  // access or modify array elements\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subsection\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also traverse a specific subsection of the array. For example, to traverse from the third to seventh element, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "for (int i = 2; i < 7; i++) {\n",
    "  // access or modify array elements\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to double every element in an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void doubleArray(int[] array) {\n",
    "  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {\n",
    "    array[i] *= 2;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## While Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "While loops can also be used to traverse an array, but for loops are more common due to their conciseness. Here's the doubling example using a while loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void doubleArray(int[] array) {\n",
    "  int i = 0;\n",
    "  while (i < array.length) {\n",
    "    array[i] *= 2;\n",
    "    i++;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terms to Remember and Review\n",
    "\n",
    "* <mark>Limited Traversal</mark>: Limited traversal refers to the process of accessing only a portion of a data structure, such as an array or list, instead of traversing through the entire structure. It allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of specific elements within the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <mark>Reverse Traversal</mark>: Reverse traversal involves accessing elements in reverse order, starting from the last element and moving towards the first element in a collection or data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <mark>Subsection</mark>: A subsection is a smaller part or division of a larger section. In programming, it refers to breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",

    "# Common Mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are some common mistakes when traversing arrays and using for-each loops in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traversing Arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Off-by-One Errors: When using traditional for-loops to traverse arrays, a common mistake is to use the wrong boundaries for the loop. Remember that array indices in Java start at 0 and go up to array.length - 1. So, if you iterate up to array.length, you’ll get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modifying Array Length: The length of an array in Java is fixed at the time of creation. Trying to change the length of the array during traversal will lead to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ignoring Returned Values: When using methods that return a value, such as arrayList.remove(index), it’s a mistake to ignore the returned value as it might be useful for the logic of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using For-Each Loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modifying Elements: A common mistake is trying to modify the array or collection you’re iterating over with a for-each loop. The loop variable in a for-each loop is a copy of the current array element, not a reference to it. So changes to the loop variable don’t affect the original array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tracking Index: For-each loops do not keep track of the index, so you cannot obtain the array index using a for-each loop. If you need to know the index of an element, a traditional for-loop might be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing Elements: You cannot call remove() during a for-each loop. If you need to remove elements while traversing, consider using an Iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterating Backwards or in Multiple Steps: For-each loops only iterate forward over the array in single steps. If you need to iterate backwards or skip elements, a traditional for-loop is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Processing Two Arrays in Parallel: For-each loops cannot process two arrays at once. If you need to traverse two arrays in parallel, a traditional for-loop is more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, choosing between a traditional for-loop and a for-each loop depends on the specific requirements of your code. Each has its own use cases and advantages."
