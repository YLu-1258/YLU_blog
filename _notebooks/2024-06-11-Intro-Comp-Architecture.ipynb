    "Intel CEO Gordon Moore proposed **Moore's Law** which predicted the growth of components that can be integrated on a chip will double each subsequent year. Often used to measure the performance of the semiconductor industry. Growth has been declining recent. The clock speeds of chips are higher as their are shorter paths between components with more components per die area. The speed of **Moore's Law** decreases as the size of compoenents approaches their physical limits. An alternative to these physical limits is **specialization**. where certain circuit components are designed to perform a specific task really well rather than a variety of tasks. An example is the **Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)**. GPUs focuses on efficiently completing repetitive computations, which is suitable for 3D graphics rendering and training Machine Learning models"
