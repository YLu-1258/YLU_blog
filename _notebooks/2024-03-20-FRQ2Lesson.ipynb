    "- Implement class with instance variables, methods, constructors \n",
    "- Inheritance (extend class, override methods), but just because you're using the methods of seperate classes in new classes DOES NOT mean you use extend when declaring class header\n",
    "- Use object or class from one class in another class\n",
    "- Use classes to store methods if they ask you to write classes\n",
    "- Realistically the only things you need to worry about is remembering to make instance variables and constructors if they ask to write one and to actually put everything within the class"
