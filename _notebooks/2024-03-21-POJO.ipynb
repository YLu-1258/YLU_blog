    "## Creating Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a class is the most basic thing you need to know to do on the second Collegeboard FRQ. This is means that you should be able to define a class with the required attributes and methods within a single unit to make the code more organized and modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some AP CSA Exam question you may need to create the entire class, but in others you may be given the class and told to fill it in with methods and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2023 Example FRQ\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sign class has two private attributes: `message` and `lineWidth`. These attributes store the message to be displayed on the sign and the width of each line, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constructor:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The class includes a constructor that initializes the `message` and `lineWidth` attributes when a Sign object is created. This constructor follows POJO principles by accepting parameters to set the initial state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`numberOfLines()`: This method calculates the number of lines needed to display the message on the sign based on the line width. It ensures that the entire message is displayed, even if it spans multiple lines.\n",
    "`getLines()`: This method formats the message into lines separated by semicolons, ensuring that each line respects the specified line width.\n",
    "`Main` Method: The main method demonstrates the usage of the `Sign` class by creating instances of Sign objects and printing information about each sign, including the message, number of lines, and formatted lines."

    "## Implementing Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Manipulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods in POJOs can perform various operations on the data they encapsulate. These operations can include calculations, transformations, validations, or any other logic necessary to modify the data according to the requirements of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavioral Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "POJOs may contain methods that represent behaviors or actions associated with the object. These methods are not necessarily related to data manipulation but instead define the behavior of the object in response to certain actions or events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods can enforce data validation rules to ensure that the data stored within the POJO remains valid and consistent. For example, a method can validate whether a certain attribute falls within a specific range or meets certain criteria before allowing it to be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Transformation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods can transform the data stored within a POJO into different formats or representations. This transformation might involve converting data types, formatting strings, or applying business rules to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex Operations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "POJO methods can encapsulate complex operations that involve multiple steps or computations. By encapsulating such operations within methods, the complexity of the implementation is hidden from the external code, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interaction with Other Objects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods in POJOs can interact with other objects, either within the same class hierarchy or external to the class. This interaction might involve invoking methods on other objects, passing data between objects, or collaborating with other objects to achieve a certain behavior or functionality."

    "- One of the things that the AP Exam commonly makes sure that you know and have during the FRQ section in teh encapsulation and access control \n",

    "### Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation is one of the 4 main OOP concepts that the AP CSA Exams tests on (the others are inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation is done through using classes and access modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ways you might be asked to do this or could see this is through defining private fields and providing setters and getters and other public methods to access and modify those fields\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation allows for protection against other parts of the program by preventing them to modify it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Control \n",
    "\n",
    "- Determines what is visible and what isn't in a program and protects data integrity \n",
    "\n",
    "- The exam might ask questions that will cause you to decide and apply the right access modifiers (private, public) and the MC section might even test your ability to determine which ones are incorrect and why\n",
    "\n",
    "- Declaring the right Access Controls can account for 4/10 of the points on the FRQ and so it is very important that you understand what and why each access control is used\n",
